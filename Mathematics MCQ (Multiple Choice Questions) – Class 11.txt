1. How to define a set?
a) A collection of well-defined objects or element
b) A collection of unordered objects or element
c) Any random elements
d) A collection of special characters
Answer: a
Explanation: Generally, a set is defined as a collection of well defined objects or elements.
Each element in a set is unique.
Say for example, if S a set it is represented as,
S = {x: 2x2 	ᵾ x< 5 and x € N}
Then the elements present in the set will be
S = {2, 8, 18, 32}.


2. How is a set denoted?
a) ()
b) {} 
c) [] 
d) ** 
Answer: b
Explanation: A set is represented by {}.

The elements are enclosed between { } denoted by small letters a, b, ……., y, z.

3. How will you define a set of all real numbers?
a) {x: -1 < x < 1} 
b) [x: -∞ < x < ∞] 
c) {x: -∞ < x < ∞} 
d) {x: -Z < x < +Z} 
Answer: c
Explanation: All the numbers whether it is an integer or rational number or irrational number is defined as Real Number. The range of the real number lies between in the range (-∞, +∞).



4. How will you define Union of two sets A and B?
a) {x: x € A or x € B}
b) {x: x € A or x € B (or both)}
c) {x: x € A and B}
d) {x: x € A – B}
Answer: b
Explanation: Union of two or more sets is the set of all elements that belongs to any of these sets.
The symbol used for this union of sets is ‘∪‘.
If A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 4, 5, 6} and C = {1, 2, 6, 8}
Then, A ∪ B ∪ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

5. How will you define the difference of two sets B-A?
a) {x: x € A and x Ɇ B}
b) {x: x Ɇ A and x € B}
c) {x: x € A and x € B}
d) {x: x Ɇ A and x Ɇ B}
Answer: b
Explanation: The difference of a set A and B is denoted as A-B. A-B is a set of those elements that are in the set A but not in the set B. Similarly, the difference of a set B and A is denoted as B-A. It is a set of those elements that are in the set B but not in the set A.


6. What will be the set of the interval (a, b]?
a) {x: a < x < b}
b) {x: a ≤ x ≤ b}
c) {x: a < x ≤ b}
d) {x: a ≤ x < b}
Answer: c

d) (-∞, ∞)
Answer: c
Explanation: f(x) = (x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)/(x3 + 6x2 + 11x+ 6)
After solving the cubic equation (x3 + 6x2 + 11x+ 6) we get (x+1)(x+2)(x+3)
Now, we can see that this implies f(x) = (x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)/(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)
So, the critical points of x are, x = 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3
So, for f(x) > 0 ᵾ x € (-∞, -3) ∪ (2, -1) ∪ (1, 2) ∪ (3, ∞).


10. What is the interval of f(x) = (x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)/(x3 + 6x2 + 11x+ 6) where f(x) is negative?

c) (-∞, -3) ∪ (2, -1) ∪ (1, 2) ∪ (3, ∞)
d) (-∞, ∞)
Answer: b
Explanation: f(x) = (x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)/(x3 + 6x2 + 11x+ 6)
After solving the cubic equation (x3 + 6x2 + 11x+ 6) we get (x+1)(x+2)(x+3)
Now, we can see that this implies f(x) = (x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)/(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)
So, the critical points of x are, x = 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3
So, for f(x) < 0 ᵾ x €  (3, -2) ∪ (1, 1) ∪ (2, 3).

11. What is the set of all x for which 1/(x – 1)(3 – x) ≤ 1?

b) (-∞, 1) ∪ (3, ∞) ∪ {2}
c) (-∞, 1) ∪ {2}
d) (3, ∞) ∪ {2}
Answer: b
Explanation: 1/(x – 1)(3 – x) ≤ 1
Now, on solving the equation further we get,
 1/(x – 1)(3 – x) -1 ≤ 0
This also implies,
1- 1/(x – 1)(3 – x) ≥ 0
(x – 1)(3 – x) – 1/(x – 1)(3 – x) ≥ 0
So, (x – 2)2/(x – 1)(3 – x) ≥ 0.
This implies, (-∞, 1) ∪ (3, ∞) ∪ {2}.

12. Which one of the following is the correct representation of set A = {2,4,8,16….} in set builder form?
a) {x: x = 2n where n ∈ N}

c) {x: x = 4n where n ∈ N}
d) {x: x = 2n+4 where n ∈ N}
Answer: b
Explanation: The sequence is a geometric progression with base 2 hence 2n is the correct answer.

13. A set can be a collection but a collection cannot be a set.
a) True
b) False
Answer: a
Explanation: A collection becomes a set when it is well defined for example a collection of good football players is not a set since the phrase “good football players” is vague and not defined.

2. Let A be set of prime numbers less than 6 and B be the set of prime factors of 30. Set A and B are ____________
a) Infinite
b) Empty
c) Singleton
d) Equal
Answer: d
Explanation: Prime numbers less than 6 are 2,3,5. A={2,3,5}
30=2*3*5 => 2,3,5 are prime factors of 30. B={2,3,5}
Since every element of A is in B and every element of B is in A so they are equal sets.

3.  A={0} and B={}. Are sets A and B are equal?
a) True
b) False
Answer: b
Explanation: Set A has one element 0 while set B has no element in it and is empty so they both can’t be equal.



4. Let X be the set of letters of the word ALLOY and Y be the set of letters of the word LOYAL. Are the sets equal?
a) True
b) False
Answer: a

Since both sets have same elements so they are equal.

5. Which of the sets are equal?
X={x : x-4=0 and x is a natural number}, Y={ x : x2=16 and x is a natural number}, Z={x : x>4 and x<16, x is a natural number}
a) X and Y
b) Y and Z
c) X and Z
d) X, Y and Z
Answer: a
Explanation: x-4=0 => x=4   X={4}
x2=16 => x2-16=0 => (x-4)(x+4)=0 => x=4,-4 but -4 is not a natural number so Y={4}
x>4 and x<16 can’t be true simultaneously so Z={ }.
Hence sets X and Y are equal.


6. Which of the following sets are equal?
X={x : x is letter of word LIFE}, Y={x : x is letter of the word WIFE}, Z={x : x is letter of the word FILE}
a) X and Y

X={1,-1}, Y={-1,1}, Z={x : x is root of x2-1=0 and x is an integer}
a) X and Y
b) Y and Z
c) X and Z
d) X, Y and Z
Answer: d
Explanation: X={1,-1} which is equal to Y{-1,1}.
x2-1=0 => (x-1)(x+1)=0 => x=1,-1. Z={1,-1} so set X,Y and Z are equal.

Mathematics Questions and Answers – Practical Problems on Union and Intersection of Two Sets

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Which of the following is correct?
a) n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B) + n (A ∩ B)
b) n (A ∪ B) = n (A) – n (B) – n (A ∩ B)
c) n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A ∩ B)
d) n (A ∩ B) = n (A) + n (B) + n (A ∪ B)
Answer: c
Explanation: In the Venn diagram,

n (A ∪ B) = a + b + c
n(A) = a + c, n(B) = b + c and n (A ∩ B) = c
n (A) + n (B) – n (A ∩ B) = (a + c) + (b + c)-c = a + b + c.
Hence, n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A ∩ B).


2. What is A ∪ B for two mutually exclusive sets A and B?
a) n (A) + n (B)
b) n (A) – n (B)
c) n (B) – n (A)
d) n (A) * n (B)
Answer: a
Explanation: We know, n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A ∩ B).
For mutually exclusive sets A ∩ B=Φ i.e. n (A ∩ B)=0.
n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B).

a) 1
b) 2
c) 7
d) 9
Answer: b
Explanation: We know, n (T ∪ C) = n (T) + n (C) – n (T ∩ C)
Given, n (T ∪ C) = 7, n(T)=4, n(C)=5
7 = 4 + 5 – n (T ∩ C)
n (T ∩ C) = 2.
Hence, 2 members like both tea and coffee.

5. In a family of 10 members, 7 of them like tea or coffee, 4 of them like tea and 5 of them like coffee. How many of them like neither tea nor coffee?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
Answer: c
Explanation: Given, n (T ∪ C) = 7.
By de Morgan’s law, n (T’ ∩ C’) = n (T ∪ C)’ = Total – n (T ∪ C) = 10 – 7 = 3.
So, 3 members like neither tea nor coffee.

Answer: a
Explanation: We know, n (T ∪ C) = n (T) + n (C) – n (T ∩ C)
Given, n (T ∪ C) = 7, n(T)=4, n(C)=5
7=4+5- n (T ∩ C)
n (T ∩ C) = 2.
n (only T) = n (T ∩ C’) = n (T)- n (T ∩ C) = 4-2=2.
2 members like only tea.

7. In a family of 10 members, 7 of them like tea or coffee, 4 of them like tea and 5 of them like coffee. How many of them like only coffee?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
Answer: b
Explanation: We know, n (T ∪ C) = n (T) + n (C) – n (T ∩ C)
Given, n (T ∪ C) = 7, n(T)=4, n(C)=5
7=4+5- n (T ∩ C)
n (T ∩ C) = 2.
n (only C) = n (C ∩ T’) = n (C) – n (T ∩ C) = 5-2=3.
3 members like only coffee.


8. In a city of 1000 population, all people read newspaper. 600 people read Hindustan Times and 700 people read Times of India. How many people read both newspaper?
a) 100
b) 300
c) 1000
d) 1300
Answer: b
Explanation: Since all people read newspaper so, n (T ∪ H) = 1000.
n(H) = 600 and n(T) = 700.
n (T ∪ H) = n (T) + n (H) – n (T ∩ H)
1000 = 700 + 600 – n (T ∩ H)
n (T ∩ H) = 1300-1000 = 300.

9. In a city of 1000 population, all people read newspaper. 600 people read Hindustan Times and 700 people read Times of India. How many people read only Hindustan Times?
a) 100
b) 200
c) 300
d) 600
Answer: c
Explanation: Since all people read newspaper so, n (T ∪ H) = 1000.
n(H) = 600 and n(T) = 700.
n (T ∪ H) = n (T) + n (H) – n (T ∩ H)
1000 = 700 + 600 – n (T ∩ H)
n (T ∩ H) = 1300-1000 = 300.
n (T’ ∩ H) = n(H)- n (T ∩ H) = 600-300 = 300.
300 persons read only Hindustan Times.


10. In a city of 1000 population, all people read newspaper. 600 people read Hindustan Times and 700 people read Times of India. How many people read only Times of India?
a) 200
b) 400
c) 600
d) 700
Answer: b
Explanation: Since all people read newspaper so, n (T ∪ H) = 1000.
n(H) = 600 and n(T) = 700.
n (T ∪ H) = n (T) + n (H) – n (T ∩ H)
1000 = 700 + 600 – n (T ∩ H)
n (T ∩ H) = 1300-1000 = 300.
n (T ∩ H’) = n (T) – n (T ∩ H) = 700-300 = 400.
400 persons read only Hindustan Times.

11. In a committee, if 50 people speak French, 20 people speak Spanish, 10 people speak both the languages, then how many people speak at least one of the two languages?
a) 10
b) 20
c) 50
d) 60
Answer: d
Explanation: We know, n (F∪S) = n (F) + n (S) – n(F∩S)
Given, n (F)=50, n (S)=20, n (F∩S) = 10
n (F∪S) = 50 + 20 – 10 = 60.
60 people speak at least one of the two languages.

12. A group conducted a survey of 100 consumers and reported that 72 consumers like apples and 45 consumers like oranges, what is the least number that must have liked both products?
a) 14
b) 15
c) 16
d) 17
Answer: d
Explanation: n(U)=100, n(A)=72, n(O)=45
n (A∪O) = n (A) + n (O) – n(A∩O)
n (A∪O) ≤ n(U) => n (A∪O) ≤ 100
Greatest value of n (A∪O) is 100 which gives least value of n(A∩O)
100=72+45 – n(A∩O)
n(A∩O) = 17 least value of n(A∩O).

13. In a population of 1000 people, 700 people play football, 600 people play cricket, and 100 people play both. Is the data correct?

Answer: d
Explanation: sin x=-4/5
We know, sin2x + cos2x=1
cos2x = 1-(-4/5)2 = 1-16/25=9/25
cos x=±3/5
cos x is negative in 3rd quadrant so, cos x=-3/5.
sec x = 1/cos x = 1/(-3/5) = – 5/3.

1. Which of the following will form the following graph?

a) sinx + cosx
b) 2sin(x/2)
c) sin2x
d) cosec(x2)
Answer: c
Explanation:

This is the curve of sinx.
It is given that the graph in the question does not lay in the –y axis.
So, when we plot the graph of sin2x the part laying in the –y axis comes in the positive y axis.


2. What is the value of tanθ?
a) √(1 + cos2θ)/cosθ
b) √(1 – cos2θ)/cosθ
c) (√(1 – cos2θ))cosθ
d) √(1 – cos2θ)+cosθ
Answer: b
Explanation: If AOB is a righted angled triangle with ∠AOB = θ and ∠BAO = 90°
Also, consider OA = x and OB = 1
By definition, cosθ = OA/OB  = x/1 = x
So, AB = √(1 – x2)
By definition, AB/OA = √(1 – x2)/x
= √(1 – cos2θ)/cosθ.

3. What will be the value of (sinx + cosecx)2 + (cosx + secx)2 ?
a) ≥ 0
b) ≤ 0
c) ≤ 1
d) ≥ 1
Answer: a
Explanation: The given expression in LHS is,
sin2x + cosec2x + 2 + cos2x + sec2x + 2
4 + (sin2x + cos2x) +(1 + tan2x) + (1 + cot2x)
= 7 + (tan2x + cot2x)
= 7 + (tanx – cotx)2 + 2 which is ≥ 0.



4. What will be the value of dy/dx = (x + 2y + 3)/(2x + 3y + 4)?
a) -2π – 9
b) 2π – 9
c) -2π + 9
d) 2π + 9
Answer: c
Explanation: We know, sec x = sec(π – x)
So, sec 6 = sec(π – 9)
= sec(2π + 9)
= sec(3π – 9)
= sec(-π – 9)
= sec(-2π – 9)
= sec(-3π – 9)
So, sec-1(sin 9) = sin-1(sin (-2π + 9))
= -2π + 9.

5. Which one is correct for Napier’s Analogy?
a) tan (C/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
b) tan (C/2) = (a – b)/(a + b) (cot(A – B)/2)
c) tan (C/2) = (a – b)/(a + b) (cot(A + B)/2)
d) tan (C/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A + B)/2)
Answer: b
Explanation: According to the law of sines, in any triangle ABC,
a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC
So, a/b = sinA/sinB
(a + b)/(a – b) = (sinA + sinB)/( sinA – sinB)
=> (a + b)/(a – b) = (2 sin((a + b)/2) cos((a – b)/2))/ (2 sin((a + b)/2) sin((a – b)/2))
=> (a + b)/(a – b) = (tan(A + B)/2)/(tan(A – B)/2)
=> (tan(A + B)/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> (tan(π/2 + C/2)) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> cot (C/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> tan (C/2) = (a – b)/(a + b) (cot(A – B)/2).


6. What is the value of (1 + cotA)(1 + cotB) for isosceles right triangle ABC right angled at A?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) Data inadequate
Answer: c
Explanation: (1 + cotA)(1 + cotB)
Simplifying the above equation,
= 1 + cotA + cotB + cotAcotB
Putting the values of A and B, we get,
= 1 + cot90 + cot45 + cot90cot45
= 1 + 0 + 1 + 0
= 2.

7. Which one is correct for Napier’s Analogy?
a) tan (A/2) = (b – c)/(b + c) (tan(B + C)/2)
b) tan (A/2) = (b – c)/(b + c) (cot(B – C)/2)
c) tan (A/2) = (b + c)/(b – c) (cot(B – C)/2)
d) tan (A) = (b – c)/(b + c) (tan(B – C)/2)
Answer: b
Explanation: According to the law of sines, in any triangle ABC,
a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC
So, a/b = sinA/sinB
(a + b)/(a – b) = (sinA + sinB)/( sinA – sinB)
=> (a + b)/(a – b) = (2 sin((a + b)/2) cos((a – b)/2))/ (2 sin((a + b)/2) sin((a – b)/2))
=> (a + b)/(a – b) = (tan(A + B)/2)/(tan(A – B)/2)
=> (tan(A + B)/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> (tan(π/2 + C/2)) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> cot (C/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> tan (C/2) = (a – b)/(a + b) (tan(A – B)/2)
Similarly, tan (A/2) = (b – c)/(b + c) (cot(B – C)/2).


8. Which one is correct for Napier’s Analogy?
a) tan (B/2) = (c – a)/(c + a) (cot(C + A)/2)
b) tan (B/2) = (c – a)/(c + a) (cot(C – A)/2)
c) tan (B/2) = (c + a)/(c – a) (cot(C – A)/2)
d) tan (B) = (c – a)/(c + a) (cot(C – A)/2)
Answer: b
Explanation: According to the law of sines, in any triangle ABC,
a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC
So, a/b = sinA/sinB
(a + b)/(a – b) = (sinA + sinB)/( sinA – sinB)
=> (a + b)/(a – b) = (2 sin((a + b)/2) cos((a – b)/2))/ (2 sin((a + b)/2) sin((a – b)/2))
=> (a + b)/(a – b) = (tan(A + B)/2)/(tan(A – B)/2)
=> (tan(A + B)/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> (tan(π/2 + C/2)) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> cot (C/2) = (a + b)/(a – b) (tan(A – B)/2)
=> tan (C/2) = (a – b)/(a + b) (cot(A – B)/2)
Similarly, tan (B/2) = (c – a)/(c + a) (cot(C – A)/2).

9. The given graph is for which equation?

a) y = (x – 1)(x – 2)
b) y = (x + 1)(x + 2)
c) y = |(x – 1)(x – 2)|
d) y = |(x + 1)(x + 2)|
Answer: c
Explanation: As the critical points are 1and 2 so the graph will form in this range only.
Clearly, as the equation is enclosed in modulus so,
The graph will lie in the positive y direction and will approach infinity.


10. The given graph is for which equation?

a) y = |(x + 1)(x – 3)|
b) y = |(x + 1)(x + 3)|
c) y = |(x – 1)(x – 3)|
d) y = -|(x + 1)(x – 3)|
Answer: a
Explanation: As, the critical points are -1 and 3,
Therefore, the curve will lie from (-1, 3)
So, this curve will cut the positive y axis at y = 3 and reach to the maximum height and come to point 3 at positive x axis.
Generally it attains a maximum height of 4 units in positive y axis.
As, the equation is enclosed by modulus so, it will lie only to upper y axis.

11. The given graph is for which equation?

a) cosecx
b) cotx
c) secx
d) cosx
Answer: c
Explanation: There are 2 curves.

The blue curve is the graph of y = cosx
The red curve is the graph for y = secx
As, secx is reciprocal of cosx, so,
The graph of secx is the reciprocal of the graph of cosx.
So, the point at which cosx attain maximum height i.e. 1 and -1 in positive and negative y axis is the point of origin of this graph that approaches to infinity.

12. The given graph is for which equation?

a) |sinx|
b) |cotx|
c) |sinx|
d) Unpredictable
Answer: b
Explanation: The above graph is for |cotx|

The blue curve is for y = cotx and red line is for |cotx|
As, half the part of graph is below x axis is negative so, due to modulus it moves to above x axis.
The graph approaches to infinity.

Mathematics Questions and Answers – The Principle of Mathematical Induction

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. For principle of mathematical induction to be true, what type of number should ‘n’ be?
a) Whole number
b) Natural number
c) Rational number
d) Any form of number
Answer: a
Explanation: According to the Principle of Mathematical induction, X(n) can be true if X(1) is true and if X(k) is true. When X(k) is true, it implies that X(k + 1) is also true. Here n can be equal to 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on.


2. 72n + 22n – 2 . 3n – 1 is divisible by 50 by principle of mathematical induction.
a) True
b) False
Answer: b
Explanation: P(n) = 72n + 22n – 2 . 3n – 1
P(1) = 72 + 20 . 30
P(1) = 50
We now assume that P(k) is divisible by 50.
Therefore, P(k) = 72k + 22k – 2 . 3k – 1
To prove P(k + 1) = 72(k – 1) + 22(k + 1) – 2 . 3(k + 1) – 1 is divisible by 50
P(k + 1) = 72k . 72 + 22k . 3k
P(k + 1) = 72 ( 72k + 22n – 2 . 3k – 1 – 22k – 2  . 3k – 1 ) + 22k . 3k
P(k + 1) = 72 x 50c – 72 . 22k – 2 . 3k – 1 + 22k . 3k
Since P(k) = 72k + 22n – 2 . 3k – 1 – 22k – 2 . 3k – 1 is divisible by 50, it can be written as 50c.
P(k + 1) =  49 x 50C – 49 . 22k – 2 . 3k – 1 + 3 x 4 x 22k – 2 . 3k – 1
P(k + 1) = 49 x 50C – 22k – 2 . 3k – 1 x 37
While the first term is divisible by 50, the second term is not.
Therefore, by principle of mathematical induction, 72n + 22n – 2 . 3n – 1 is not divisible by 50.

3. By principle of mathematical induction, 24n-1 is divisible by which of the following?
a) 8
b) 3
c) 5
d) 7
Answer: a
Explanation:
P(n) = 24n – 1
P(1) = 23 = 8
Let us assume P(k) is divisible by 8 and can be written as 8c, where c is any integer.
P(k) = 24k – 1 = 8c
P(k + 1) = 24(k + 1) – 1
P(k + 1) = 24k + 3
P(k + 1) = 24 . 24k – 1
P(k + 1) = 24 . 8c
Clearly, P(k + 1) is divisible by 2, 4, 8 and 16.



4. If 103n + 24k + 1. 9 + k, is divisible by 11, then what is the least positive value of k?
a) 7
b) 6
c) 8
d) 10
Answer: d
Explanation: P(n) = 103n + 24k + 1. 9 + k
P(1) = 103 + 25 . 9 + k
P(1) = 1000 + 288 + k
P(1) = 1288 + k
When 1288 is divided by 11, the remainder is 1.
Therefore, 1287 is divisible by 11.
The next number that is divisible is 1298.
k = 1298 – 1288
k = 10

5. P(n) = n(n2 – 1). Which of the following does not divide P(k+1)?
a) k
b) k + 2
c) k + 3
d) k + 1
Answer: c
Explanation: P(n) = n(n2 – 1)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1) ((k + 1)2 – 1)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1) (k2 + 1 + 2k – 1)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1) (k2 + 2k)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1) k (k + 2)
Therefore, k, (k + 1), (k – 1) divide P(k + 1).


6. What would be the hypothesis of mathematical induction for n(n + 1) < n! (where n ≥ 4) ?
a) It is assumed that at n = k, k(k + 1)! > k!
b) It is assumed that at n = k, k(k + 1)! < k!
c) It is assumed that at n = k, k(k + 1)! > (k + 1)!
d) It is assumed that at n = k, (k + 1)(k + 2)! < k!
Answer: b
Explanation: When we use the principle of mathematical induction, we assume that P(n) is true for P(k) and prove that P(k + 1) is also true. Here P(k) is k(k + 1)! < k!

7. If P(k) = k2 (k + 3) (k2 – 1) is true, then what is P(k + 1)?
a) (k + 1)2 (k + 3) (k2 – 1)
b) (k + 1)2 (k + 4) (k2 – 1)
c) (k + 1)2 (k + 4) k (k + 2)
d) (k + 1) (k + 4) k (k +2)
Answer: c
Explanation: In mathematical induction, if P(k) is true, we need to prove that P(k + 1) is also true. Here P(k + 1) is found by substituting (k + 1) in place of k. P(k + 1) = (k + 1)2 (k + 1 + 3) ((k + 1)2 – 1)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1)2 (k + 4) (k2 + 1 + 2k – 1)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1)2 (k + 4) (k2 + 2k)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1)2 (k + 4) k (k +2)


8. n2 + 3n is always divisible by which number, provided n is an integer?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
Answer: a
Explanation: P(n) = n2 + 3n
P(1) = 1 + 3
P(1) = 4
Let’s assume that P(k) is true and divisible by 4. Therefore, P(k) = k2 + 3k can be written as 4c.
We need to check if P(k + 1) is divisible by 4
P(k+1) = (k + 1)2 + 3(k + 1)
P(k+1) = k2 + 1 + 2k + 3k + 3
P(k+1) = k2 + 5k + 4
P(k+1) = (k2 + 3k) + 2k + 4
P(k+1) = 4c + 2k + 4
P(k+1) = 4c + 2(k + 2)
Clearly the second part of the equation is not divisible by 4. However P(k) = 4c is divisible by 2 and
P(k + 1) is also divisible by 2. Therefore, 2 divides P(n).

9. n3 + 5n is divisible by which of the following?
a) 3
b) 5
c) 7
d) 11
Answer: a
Explanation: P(n) = n3 + 5n
P(1) = 1 + 5
P(1) = 6
We assume the P(k) is true and divisible by 6.
P(k) = k3 + 5k is divisible by 6 and can be written as 6c or 3 x 2c
We need to prove that P(k + 1) is divisible by 6
P(k + 1) = (k + 1)3 + 5(k + 1)
P(k + 1) = k3 + 1 + 3k2 + 3k + 5k + 5
P(k + 1) = (k3 + 5k) + 3k2 + 3k + 6
P(k + 1) = 6c + 3(k2 + k + 2)
P(k + 1) = (3 x 2c) + 3(k2 + k + 2)
Therefore, P(k + 1) is definitely divisible by 3


10. State whether the following series is true or not.
1 + 2 + 3  +…..+ n = \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\) 
a) True 
b) False 
Answer: a
Explanation: P(n) = n(n + 1)/2
P(1) = 1
We assume P(k) to be true, therefore, P(k) = \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\) 
To prove that, P(k + 1) = \(\frac{(k+1)(k+ 2)}{2}\) 
Proof:
P(k + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 +….+ k + k + 1 
P(k + 1) = \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\) + k+1 
P(k + 1) = \(\frac{k(k+ 1)+2(k+1)}{2}\) 
P(k + 1) = \(\frac{(k+1)(k+ 2)}{2}\) 
Therefore, P(n) is true by principle of mathematical induction. 

11. What will be P(k + 1) for P(n) = n3 (n + 1)?
a) (k + 1)4
b) k4 + 5k3 + 9k2 + 7k + 2
c) k4 + 6k3 + 9k2 + 7k + 2
d) k4 + 3k3 + 9k2 + 6k + 2
Answer: b
Explanation: P(n) = n3 (n + 1)
P(k + 1) = (k + 1)3 (k + 1 + 1)
P(k + 1) = (k3 + 3k2 + 3k + 1) (k + 2)
P(k + 1) = k4 + 3k3 + 3k2 + k + 2k3 + 6k2 + 6k + 2
P(k + 1) = k4 + 5k3 + 9k2 + 7k + 2

Mathematics Questions and Answers – Quadratic Equations – 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If acosθ + bsinθ = c have roots α and β. Then, what will be the value of sinα + sinβ?
a) 2bc/(a2 + b2)
b) 0
c) 1
d) (c2 + a2)/(a2 + b2)
Answer: a
Explanation: Given, acosθ + bsinθ = c
So, this implies acosθ = c – bsinθ
Now squaring both the sides we get,
(acosθ)2 = (c – bsinθ)2
a2 cos2 θ = c2 + b2 sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ
a2 (1- sin2 θ) = c2 + b2 sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ
a2 – a2 sin2 θ = c2 + b2 sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ
Now rearranging the elements,
(a2 + b2) sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ  +( c2 – a2) = θ
So, as sum of the roots are in the form –b/a if there is a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0
Now, we can conclude that
sinα + sinβ = 2bc/(a2 + b2).


2. If acosθ + bsinθ = c have roots α and β. Then, what will be the value of sinα * sinβ ?
a) 2bc/(a2 + b2)
b) 0
c) 1
d) (c2 + a2)/(a2 + b2)
Answer: d
Explanation: Given, acosθ + bsinθ = c
So, this implies acosθ = c – bsinθ
Now squaring both the sides we get,
(acosθ)2 = (c – bsinθ)2
a2 cos2 θ = c2 + b2 sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ
a2 (1- sin2 θ) = c2 + b2 sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ
a2 – a2 sin2 θ = c2 + b2 sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ
Now rearranging the elements,
(a2 + b2) sin2 θ – 2b c sinθ  +( c2 – a2) = θ
So, as sum of the roots are in the formc/a if there is a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0
Now , we can conclude that
sinα + sinβ = (c2 + a2)/(a2 + b2).

3. If x2 + ax + b = 0 and x2 + bx + a = 0 have exactly 1 common root then what is the value of (a + b)?
a) 1
b) 0
c) -1
d) 3
Answer: c
Explanation: Subtracting the equation x2 + ax + b = 0 to x2 + bx + a = 0 by solving the equation simultaneously, we get,
(a – b)x + (b – a) = 0
So, (a – b)x = (a – b)
Therefore, x = 1
Now, putting the value of x = 3 in any one of the equation, we get,
1 + a + b = 0
Therefore, a + b = -1.



4. If, α and β are the roots of the equation 2x2 – 3x – 6 = 0, then what is the equation whose roots are α2 + 2 and β2 + 2?
a) 4x2 + 49x + 118 =0
b) 4x2 – 49x + 118 =0
c) 4x2 – 49x – 118 =0
d) x2 – 49x + 118 =0
Answer: b
Explanation: Let, y = x2 + 2
Then, 2x2 – 3x – 6 = 0
So, (3x)2 = (2x2 – 6)2
[2(y-2) – 6]2 = 9(y-2)
= 4x2 – 49x + 118 = 0.

5. If p and q are the roots of the equation x2 + px + q =0 then, what are the values of p and q?
a) p = 1, q = -2
b) p = 0, q = 1
c) p = -2, q = 0
d) p = -2, q = 1
Answer: a
Explanation: Since, p and q are the roots of the equation x2 + px + q =0
So, p + q = -p and pq = q
So, pq = q
And, q = 0 or p = 1
If, q = 0 then, p = 0 and if p = 1 then q = -2.


6. If x2 + px + 1 = 0 and (a – b)x2 + (b – c)x + (c – a) = 0 have both roots common, then what is the form of a, b, c?
a) a, b, c are in A.P
b) b, a, c are in A.P
c) b, a, c are in G.P
d) b, a, c are in H.P
Answer: b
Explanation: Given, (a – b)x2 + (b – c)x + (c – a) = 0 and x2 + px + 1 =0
So, 1 / (a – b) = p / (b – c) = 1 / (c – a)
Equating the above equation, we get,
(b – c) = p(a – b)	     and
(b – c) = p(c – a)
So, p(a – b) = p(c – a)
=> a – b = c – a
So, 2a = b + c which means that b, a, c are in A.P.

7. What will be the sum of b + c if the equations x2 + bx + c = 0 and x2 + 3x + 3 = 0 have one common root?
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 8
Answer: c
Explanation: Comparing the coefficients of the above equation we get,
1/1 = b/3 = c/3
This means b = 3 and c = 3
Therefore, b + c = 6.


8. If |z1| = 4, |z2| = 3, then what is the value of |z1 + z2 + 3 + 4i|?
a) Less than 2
b) Less than 5
c) Less than 7
d) Less than 12
Answer: d
Explanation: As, we know | z1 + z2 + …….. +zn| ≤ |z1| + |z2| + ………. + |zn|
So, |z1 + z2 + 3 + 4i| ≤ |z1| + |z2| + |3 + 4i|
Now, putting the given values in the equation, we get,
=> |z1 + z2 + 3 + 4i| ≤ 4 + 3 + √(9 + 16)
=> |z1 + z2 + 3 + 4i| ≤ 4 + 3 + 5
=> |z1 + z2 + 3 + 4i| ≤ 12.

9. According to De Moivre’s theorem what is the value of z1/n ?
a) r1/n [cos(2kπ + θ) + i sin(2kπ + θ)] 
b) r1/n [cos(2kπ + θ)/n – i sin(2kπ + θ)/n] 
c) r1/n [cos(2kπ + θ)/n + i sin(2kπ + θ)/n] 
d) r1/n [cos(2kπ + θ) – i sin(2kπ + θ)] 
Answer: c
Explanation: If n is any integer, then (cosθ + isinθ)n = cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ).
Writing the binomial expansion of (cosθ + isinθ)n and equating real parts of cos(nθ) and the imaginary part to sin(nθ), we get,
cos(nθ) = cosnθ – nC2 cosn-2θ sin2θ + nC4 cosn-4θ sin4θ + ……….
sin(nθ) = nC1 cosn-1θ sinθ – nC3 cosn-3θ sin3θ + ……….
If, n is a rational number, then one of the value of (cosθ + isinθ)n = cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ).
If, n = p/q, where, p and q are integers (q>θ) and p, q have no common factor, then (cosθ + isinθ)n has q distinct values one of which is cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)
If, z1/n = r1/n [cos(2kπ + θ)/n + i sin(2kπ + θ)/n], where k = 0, 1, 2, ……….., n – 1.

a) 3
b) 4
c) 6
d) 9
Answer: d
Explanation: Comparing the coefficients of the above equation we get,
1/1 = b/3 = c/3
This means b = 3 and c = 3
Therefore, b * c = 9.

1. If, (a + 1)x2 + 2(a+1)x + (a – 2) = 0, then, for what parameter of ‘a’ the given equation have real and distinct roots?
a) (-∞, ∞)
b) (-1, ∞)
c) [-1, ∞)
d) (-1, 1)
Answer: b
Explanation: For, real and distinct roots, D > 0
Where, D = b2 – 4ac
In the equation, (a + 1)x2 + 2(a+1)x + (a – 2) = 0
D = [2(a+1)]2 – 4 (a + 1)(a – 2)
    = 4a2 + 4 + 8a – 4{a2 – 2a + a – 2}
    = 4a2 + 4 + 8a – 4a2 + 4 a + 8 > 0
    => 12a + 12 > 0
    => 12a > -12
   => a > -1
Therefore, a € (-1, ∞)


2. If, (a + 1)x2 + 2(a+1)x + (a – 2) = 0, then, for what parameter of ‘a’ the given equation have equal roots?
a) (-∞, -1)
b) [-1, ∞)
c) (0, 1)
d) Not possible
Answer: d
Explanation: For, equal roots, D = 0
Where, D = b2 – 4ac
In the equation, (a + 1)x2 + 2(a+1)x + (a – 2) = 0
D = [2(a+1)]2 – 4 (a + 1)(a – 2)
    = 4a2 + 4 + 8a – 4{a2 – 2a + a – 2}
    = 4a2 + 4 + 8a – 4a2 + 4 a + 8 > 0
    => 12a + 12 = 0
    => 12a = -12
    => a = -1
So, from here it is clear that a = -1 is not possible because the equation is becoming linear.

3. If, (a + 1)x2 + 2(a+1)x + (a – 2) = 0, then, for what parameter of ‘a’ the given equation have imaginary roots?
a) (-∞, -1)
b) (-1, ∞)
c) (-1, 1)
d) (-∞, ∞)
Answer: a
Explanation: For, imaginary roots, D > 0
Where, D = b2 – 4ac
In the equation, (a + 1)x2 + 2(a+1)x + (a – 2) = 0
D = [2(a+1)]2 – 4 (a + 1)(a – 2)
    = 4a2 + 4 + 8a – 4{a2 – 2a + a – 2}
    = 4a2 + 4 + 8a – 4a2 + 4 a + 8 < 0
    => 12a + 12 < 0
    => 12a < -12
    => a < -1
Therefore, a € (-∞, -1)



4. If x1, x2 are real roots of ax2 – x + a = 0. Then, find the set of all values of parameter ‘a’ for which |x1 – x1| < 1?
a) (1 – 5a)/ a2 < 0
b) (1 – 5a)/ a2 = 0
c) (1 – 5a)/ a2 > 0
d) (1 – 5a)/ a < 0
Answer: a
Explanation: |x1 – x2| < 1
 = (x1 – x2)2 < 1
= (x1 + x2)2 – 4 x1 x2 -1 < 0
= (1/a)2 – 4 – 1 < 0
= (1 – 5a)/a2 < 0.

5. What is the value of x if (a + 2b – 3c)x2 + (b + 2c – 3a)x + (c + 2a – 3b) = 0 where a, b, c are in A.P?
a) 1/2
b) 1/4
c) 2/3
d) 3/4
Answer: b
Explanation: If the coefficients of (x2 + x + c) = 0, then
x will always be = 1
Therefore, here, (a + 2b – 3c) + (b + 2c – 3a) + (c + 2a – 3b) = 0
So, x = 1.
As, one of its root is 1 so, we will calculate the other one.
As, a, b, c are in A.P so,
b = (a + c)/2
Thus, product of the roots αβ = (c + 2a – 3b)/(a + 2b – 3c)
As, a root say α = 1, then,
β = (c + 2a – 3(a + c)/2) / (a + 2(a + c)/2 – 3c)
We get the value of β = 1/4


6. What will be the value of f(x) if, 2A, A + B, C are integers and f(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C = 0?
a) Natural Number
b) Unpredictable
c) Integer
d) Complex Number
Answer: c
Explanation: f(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C = 0
So, f(x) = Ax2 + (A + B)x – Ax + C
              = Ax2 – Ax + (A + B)x + C
              = 2Ax(x – 1)/2 + (A + B)x + C
Therefore, f(x) is an integer.

d) (1, 0) ∪ (1, ∞)
Answer: d
Explanation: If, x2 > 1, then x + 1 > 0
So, x > 0
	x € (1, ∞)
 If, 0 < x < 1, the 0 < x + 1 < 1
	x € (-1, 0)
Thus, x € (1, ∞) ∪ (1, ∞)

11. What is the set of values of p for which the roots of the equation 3x2 + 2x + p(p – 1) = 0 are of opposite sign?
a) (-∞, 0)
b) (0, 1)

c) 2nπ + π/6 ≤ θ ≤ 2nπ + 5π/6
d) 2nπ + π/3 ≤ θ ≤ 2nπ + 5π/3
Answer: a
Explanation: Let, f(x) = 3x2 – 3sinθ x – 2cos2θ
The coefficient of x2 > 0
	f(1) < 0
So, 3 – 3sinθ – 2cos2θ < 0
    => 2sin2θ – 3sinθ + 1 < 0
    => (2sinθ – 1)(sinθ – 1) < 0
    => ½  2nπ + π/6 < θ < 2nπ + 5π/6

13. A real number ‘a’ is called a good number if the inequality (2x2 – 2x – 3) / (x2 + x + 1) ≤ a is satisfied for all real x. What is the set of all real numbers?
a) (-∞, 10/3] 
b) (10/3, ∞) 
c) [10/3, ∞) 
d) [-10/3, ∞) 
Answer: c
Explanation: We have, (2x2 – 2x – 3) / (x2 + x + 1) ≤ a ᵾ x € R
=> 2x2 – 2x – 3 ≤ a(x2 + x + 1) ᵾ x € R
=> (2 – a)x2 – (2 – a)x – (3 – a) ᵾ x € R
2 – a < 0 and (2 – a)x2 – 4(2 – a)(3 – a) ≤ 0 ᵾ x € R
So, a > 2 and a ≤ 2 or a ≥ 10/3
=> a ≥ 10/3
Therefore, a € [10/3, ∞)

14. Let S denotes the set of all real values of the parameter ‘a’ for which every solution of the inequality log1/2 x2 ≥ log1/2 (x + 2) is the solution of the inequality 49x2 – 4a4 ≤ 0. What is the value of S?
a) (-∞, -√7) ∪ (√7, ∞)
b) (-∞, -√7] ∪ [√7, ∞)
c) (-√7, √7)
d)  [-√7, √7] 
Answer: b
Explanation: We have, log1/2 x2 ≥ log1/2 (x + 2)
=> x2 ≤ x + 2
=> -1 ≤ x ≤ 2
And, 49x2 – 4a4 ≤ 0 i.e. x2 ≤ 4a4 / 49
=> -2a2/7 ≤ a ≤ 2a2/7
From the above equations,
-2a2/7 ≤ -1 and 2 ≤ 2a2/7
i.e. a2 €  7/2 and a2 ≥ 7
=> a € (-∞, -√7] ∪ [√7, ∞)
So, S = (-∞, -√7] ∪ [√7, ∞)

15. If, x4 + 4x3 + 6ax2 + 6bx + c is divisible by x3 + 3x2 + 9x + 3. Then, what is the value of a + b + c?
a) 4
b) 6
c) 7
d) 10
Answer: c
Explanation: Here, f(x) = x4 + 4x3 + 6ax2 + 6bx + c so, let its roots be, α, β, γ, δ and
g(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 9x + 3 so, let its roots be, α, β, γ
So, from here we can conclude,
α + β + γ + δ = -4 and α + β + γ = -3
Thus, δ = -1
This means (x + 1)(x3 + 3x2 + 9x + 3)
On solving this equation in simpler form we get,
x4 + 4x3 + 12x2 + 12x + 3
=> 6a = 12 => a = 2
=> 6b = 12 => b = 2
=> c = 3
=> a + b + c = 7

Explanation: Since region involves 1st quadrant so x≥0, y≥0.
Two points on line are (0,6) and (3,0).
(y-6)/(0-6) = (x-0)/(3-0)
=>(y-6)/(-6) = x/3
=>y-6=-2x => 2x+y=6
2x+y≤6 since (0,0) should also satisfy.
So, 2x+y≤6, x≥0, y≥0.

b) [20°, 25°] 
c) [25°, 30°] 
d) [30°, 35°] 
Answer: c
Explanation: F = 9/5 C + 32°
C=(F-32°)*5/9
77° ≤ F ≤ 86°
=> 77°-32° ≤ F-32° ≤ 86° -32°
=> 45° ≤ F-32° ≤ 54°
=>45o*5/9 ≤ (F-32°) *5/9 ≤ 54°*5/9
=>25° ≤ C ≤ 30°.

d) 100
Answer: c
Explanation: Words starting with letter A comes first in dictionary. Starting with A, number of words = 4! = 24. Starting with E, number of words = 4! = 24. Starting with I, number of words = 4! = 24. Starting with G, number of words = 4! = 24. Since our word also start with M so, we have to consider one more letter i.e. MA. Since our word also start with MA so, we have to consider one more letter i.e. MAE. Starting with MAE, number of words = 2! = 2. Since our word also start with MAG so, we have to consider one more letter i.e. MAGE. Starting with MAGE, only one letter i.e. MAGEI. After this, MAGIE comes. Total number of words before MAGIE = 24 + 24 + 24 + 24 + 2 = 98. So, rank of MAGIE is 99.

b) 9 \(\frac{2}{3}\) 
c) 9 \(\frac{1}{3}\) 
d) 9 \(\frac{1}{4}\) 
Answer: b
Explanation: Using binomial theorem we know that (a + b)3 = a3 + 3ab2 + 3a2b + b3
Therefore, (7 + 2)3 = 73 + 23 + (3 x 7 x 22) + (3 x 2 x 72)
(9)3 = 73 + 23 + 84 + (3 x 2 x 72)
729 = 73 + 23 + 84 + 294
73 + 23 + 84 = 435
Also 72 – 22 = (7 – 2)(7 + 2)
72 – 22 = (5)(9)
72 – 22 = 45
So \(\frac{7^3 + 2^3 + 84}{7^2-2^2}\) = 435 / 45
= 9 \(\frac{30}{45}\)   
= 9 \(\frac{2}{3}\).

Mathematics Questions and Answers – Binomial Theorem – General and Middle Terms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is the general term of (x – y)xy?
a) x – yCr (xxy – r . yr)
b) xyCr (xx – y – r . -yr)
c) xyCr (xxy – r . -yr)
d) x – yCr (xx – y – r . yr)
Answer: c
Explanation: The general term of a binomial series is given by nCr an – r br.
Here a = x, b = -y and n = xy
Therefore the general term is given by xyCr (xxy – r . -yr).


2. What is the value of n, if the coefficients of the second term of (x – y)3 is equal to the third term of the expansion (x + y)n?
a) –2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
Answer: b
Explanation: Coefficient of the second term of (x – y)3 is 3C1 and the coefficient of the third term of the expansion (x + y)n is nC2.
3C1 = nC2 
3 = \(\frac{n!}{2!(n – 2)!}\) 
6 = \(\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)!}{(n – 2)!}\) 
6 = n2 – n 
n2 – n – 6 = 0 
n2 – 3n + 2n – 6 = 0 
(n – 3) (n + 2) = 0
n = 3, – 2
Since n cannot be negative, n = 3.

3. Which term will be the middle term of (xyz – x)2n?
a) (n + 1)th term
b) (n + 2)th term
c) nth term
d) (n – 1)th term
Answer: a
Explanation: Clearly 2n is an even number and the binomial has 2n + 1 terms.
The middle term for a binomial with even power, is the term equal to (n/2 + 1) where n is number of terms.
In this case,  (2n/2 + 1) = n + 1.



4. What is the middle term of (4 + 2x)6?
a) 11240 x2
b) 10240 x3
c) 12240 x4
d) 10340 x4
Answer: b
Explanation: The middle term will be the 4th term
4th term = 6C3 (4)6 – 3(2x)3
= 20 (64) (8x3)
= 10240 x3

5. What is the middle term of (x2 + x)3?
a) 3x4
b) 6x4
c) 4x4
d) 3x6
Answer: a
Explanation:
Since the power is odd, there will be even number of terms and two middle terms.
r = \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) and r = \(\frac{n – 1}{2}\)
Here n = 3
Therefore, r = 2 and r = 1.
When r = 2, 3C2 (x2)3 – 2(x)2 = 3x4
When r = 1, 3C1 (x2)3 – 1(x)1 = 3x5


6. Which of the following values of n are possible, if the middle term of (x + 3y)n is the fifth term.
a) 6, 7 or 8
b) 7, 8 or 10
c) 7, 8 or 9
d) 8, 9 or 10
Answer: c
Explanation: If n is the number of terms and is even, then the middle term is the \((\frac{n}{2} + 1)^{th}\) term.
Else if n is the number of terms and is odd, there are two middle terms which are the \((\frac{n + 1}{2})^{th}\) term and the \((\frac{n + 3}{2})^{th}\) term.
Case 1: \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) = 5 ; n = 8
Case 2: \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) = 5 ; n = 9
Case 3: \(\frac{n + 3}{2}\) = 5 ; n = 7

7. What is the even value of n, if the middle term of (a + b)2n – 3 is 11?
a) 12
b) 10
c) 20
d) 22
Answer: a
Explanation: If 2n – 3 is even, then the middle term is the \((\frac{2n-3}{2}+1)^{th}\) term.
Else if 2n – 3 is odd, there are two middle terms which are the \((\frac{2n-3+1}{2})^{th}\) term and the \((\frac{2n-3+3}{2})^{th}\) term.
Case 1: \(\frac{2n-3}{2}\) + 1= 11 ; n = 11.5
Case 2: \(\frac{2n-2}{2}\) = 11 ; n = 12
Case 3: \(\frac{2n}{2}\) = 11 ; n = 11


8. What is the value of n if the middle term (x + 2y)2n + 1 is the 19th term?
a) 33
b) 34
c) 35
d) 38
Answer: c
Explanation: Clearly (2n + 1) is an odd number. Therefore this is a case of binomial with an odd power.
For a binomial expansion with odd power, there are two middle terms.
Case 1: \(\frac{n+1}{2}\) = 19
Therefore n = 37
Case 2: \(\frac{n+3}{2}\) = 19
Therefore n = 35

9. If the general term is 91C2 x89, what is the expansion?
a) (x)91
b) (x – 2)90
c) (x – 1)91
d) (x + 1)90
Answer: c
Explanation: The general term of an expansion is nCr xn – r yr.
Clearly here n is 91 and the first term is x raised to the power 89.
The second term is raised to power 2.
y2 = 1
y = +1 or -1
Therefore the expansion can either be (x + 1)91 or (x – 1)91.


10. What is the middle term of (xyz + 3)80?
a) 80C41 (xyz)41 (3)39
b) 80C40 (xyz)40 (3)40
c) 80C39 (xyz)39 (3)40
d) 80C41 (xyz)41 (3)40
Answer: b
Explanation: Since the power is even, there are odd number of terms.
The middle term is the \((\frac{n}{2} + 1)^{th}\) term.
= \((\frac{80}{2} + 1)^{th}\) term
= 41st term
The 41st term = 80C40 (xyz)40 (3)40

11. What is the coefficient of the middle term of (z + y)3x, if 3x is considered to be even and the middle term is the 4th term?
a) 7C3
b) 6C2
c) 6C3
d) 7C2
Answer: a
Explanation: Since the middle term is the fourth term
Considering 3x to be even, \((\frac{3x + 1}{2})^{th}\) term = 4
x = 7/3
Therefore, the fourth term coefficients are 7C3

12. What is the fourth term of (x – 5y)96?
a) 125 96C3 x93 y3
b) 625 96C3 x93 y4
c) 625 96C4 x92 y4
d) 125 96C4 x92 y4
Answer: a
Explanation: Tr + 1 = nCr xn – r yr
Here first term is 4 and second term is 5y.
n = 96
r = 3
Therefore, Tr + 1 = 96C3 x96 – 3 (5y)3
= 125 96C3 x93 y3

a) an = a + (n-1) d
b) an = a + (n) d
c) an = a*rn-1
d) an = a*rn
Answer: a
Explanation: Since every term of an A.P. is incremented by common difference d.
i.e. an+1 = an + d = an-1 + 2d = ……. = a1 + n*d
or an = a + (n-1) d

a) 4:5
b) 5:4
c) 9:31
d) 31:9
Answer: c
Explanation: Let a, a’ be the first terms and d, d’ be the common differences of 2 A.P.’s respectively.
Given, \(\frac{\frac{n}{2}[2a+(n-1)d]}{\frac{n}{2}[2a’+(n-1)d’]} = \frac{2n+3}{7n+5}\) 
=>\(\frac{a+(n-1)d/2}{a’+(n-1) d’/2} = \frac{2n+3}{7n+5}\) 
If we have to find ratio of 9th terms then (n-1)/2 =8 => n=17
=>\(\frac{a+8d}{a’+8d’} = \frac{2*17+3}{7*17+5} = \frac{34+3}{119+5} = \frac{36}{124}\) = 9/31.

5. If two numbers are 2 and 6 then find their arithmetic mean.

Answer: d
Explanation: Let A.P. be 2, A1, A2, A3, A4, 22.
=>a=2 and a6 = a+5d = 22 => 2+5*d=22 => d=4.
A1 = a2 = a + d = 2 + 4 = 6.
A2 = A1 + d = 6 + 4 = 10.
A3 = 10 + 4 = 14.
A4 = 14 + 4 = 18.

12. The sum of first three terms of a G.P. is 21/2 and their product is 27. Find the common ratio.
a) 2
b) 1/2
c) 2 or 1/2
d) neither 2 nor 1/2
Answer: c
Explanation: Let three terms be a/r, a, a*r.
Product = 27 => (a/r) (a) (a*r) = 27 => a3 = 27
=>a = 3.
Sum = 21/2 => (a / r + a + a*r) = 21/2 => a (1 / r + 1 + 1*r) = 21/2
=> (1 / r + 1 + 1*r) = (21/2)/3 = 7/2
=> (r2 + r + 1) = (7/2) r => r2 – (5/2) r + 1 = 0
=> r = 2 and 1/2.

13. The sum of first three terms of a G.P. is 21/2 and their product is 27. Which of the following is not a term of the G.P. if the numbers are positive?
a) 3
b) 2/3
c) 3/2
d) 6
Answer: b
Explanation: Let three terms be a/r, a, a*r.
Product = 27 => (a/r) (a) (a*r) = 27 => a3 = 27
=>a = 3.
Sum = 21/2 => (a / r + a + a*r) = 21/2 => a (1 / r + 1 + 1*r) = 21/2
=> (1 / r + 1 + 1*r) = (21/2)/3 = 7/2
=> (r2 + r + 1) = (7/2) r => r2 – (5/2) r +1 = 0
=> r = 2 and 1/2.

a) 256
b) 16
c) 64
d) 128
Answer: d
Explanation: Let G.P. be 4, G1, G2, G3, 512.
=>a=4 and a5 = a*r4 = 512 => 4*r4 = 512 => r4 = 512/4 = 128 => r = 4.
G1 = a2 = a * r = 4*4 = 16.
G2 = G1 * r = 16 * 4 = 64.
G3 = G2 * r = 64*4 = 256.

Mathematics Questions and Answers – Relationship Between A.M. and G.M.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If A.M. of two numbers is 15/2 and their G.M. is 6, then find the two numbers.
a) 6 and 8
b) 12 and 3
c) 24 and 6
d) 27 and 3
Answer: b
Explanation: We know, A.M. of two numbers a and b is (a + b)/2
=> (a + b)/2 = 15/2 => a + b = 15.
Also, G.M. of two numbers a and b is \(\sqrt{ab}\) 
=> \(\sqrt{ab}\) = 6 => ab = 36.
=> a(15-a) = 36 => a=3 or 12.
For a=3, b=12.
For a=12, b=3.
So, the two numbers are 3 and 12.


2. Which of the following is true if A means arithmetic mean and b means geometric mean of two numbers?
a) A>G
b) A≥G
c) G<A
d) G≤A
Answer: b
Explanation: We know, A.M. of two numbers a and b is (a + b)/2
Also, G.M. of two numbers a and b is \(\sqrt{ab}\) 
A-G = (a + b)/2 – \(\sqrt{ab} = ((a + b) – 2\sqrt{ab})/2 = (\sqrt{a} – \sqrt{b})^2\) / 2 ≥ 0
So, A≥G.

3. If the sum of two numbers is 4 times the geometric mean then find the ratio of numbers.
a) \(\frac{8±3\sqrt{5}}{1}\) 
b) \(\frac{8±3\sqrt{7}}{1}\) 
c) \(\frac{6±3\sqrt{5}}{1}\) 
d) \(\frac{6±3\sqrt{7}}{1}\) 
Answer: b
Explanation: We know, G.M. of two numbers a and b is √ab.
So, a + b = 4 √ab
Squaring we get, a2+b2 = 16ab
=>(a/b) + (b/a) = 16
Let x = a/b.
So, x + 1/x = 16 => x2 – 16x + 1 = 0
=>x = \(\frac{16±\sqrt{256-4}}{2} = \frac{16±\sqrt{252}}{2} = \frac{16±6\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{8±3\sqrt{7}}{1}\).



4. The ratio of the A.M. and G.M. of two positive numbers a and b is 5: 3. Find the ratio of a to b.
a) 9:1
b) 3:5
c) 1:9
d) 3:1
Answer: a
Explanation: (A.M.)/(G.M.) = 5/3
=> \(\frac{a+b}{2\sqrt{ab}} = \frac{5}{3}\) 
Applying componendo and dividendo rule, we get
=> \(\frac{a+b+2\sqrt{ab}}{a+b-2\sqrt{ab}} = \frac{8}{2}\) 
=> \((\frac{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b}})^2=4 \) 
=> \((\frac{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b}})^1=2\) 
=> \((\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}})^1=3\) 
Again applying componendo and dividendo rule, we get
a/b = (3/1)2 = 9. So, a:b =9:1.

c) \(\frac{(n-2)(2n-5)}{3}\) 
d) \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n-5)}{3}\) 
Answer: b
Explanation: Given, nth term is n(n-2)
So, ak = k(k-2)
Taking summation from k=1 to k=n on both sides, we get
\(\sum_{i=0}^n a_k = \sum_{i=0}^n k^2 – 2 \sum_{i=0}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} – 2\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n-5)}{6}\).

7. Find the sum of series up to 6th term whose nth term is given by n2 + 3n.
a) 91
b) 1284
c) 1183
d) 1092
Answer: c
Explanation: Given, nth term is n2 + 3n
So, ak = k2 + 3k
Taking summation from k=1 to k=n on both sides, we get
\(\sum_{i=0}^na_k = \sum_{i=0}^nk^2 + \sum_{i=0}^n3^k\) 
\(\sum_{i=0}^nk^2 = n(n+1) (2n+1)/6\) 
\(\sum_{i=0}^n3^k = 3*(3^n-1)/ (3-1) = (3/2) (3^n-1)\) 
So, \(\sum_{i=0}^na_k = n(n+1) (2n+1)/6 + (3/2) (3^n-1)\) 
Sum up to 6th term = 6*7*13/6 + (3/2) (36-1) = 91+1092 = 1183.

d) 420
Answer: a
Explanation: Sn = 2+3+5+8+12+……………………………+ an
Sn = 2+3+5+8+12+ ……. + an-1 + an
Subtracting we get, 0 = 2+1+2+3+4+………………………….. – an
=>an = 2+1+2+3+4+…………….+(n-1) = 2+(n-1)n/2 = (1/2) (n2-n+4)
nth term is (1/2) (n2-n+4)
So, ak = (1/2) (k2-k+4)
Taking summation from k=1 to k=n on both sides, we get
\(\sum_{i=0}^na_k = (1/2)\sum_{i=0}^nk^2 – (1/2)\sum_{i=0}^nk + 2n\) = n(n+1) (2n+1)/(2*6) – n(n+1)/4 + 2n
Here, n=7. So, \(\sum_{i=0}^na_k\) = (7*8*15)/12 – (7*8)/4 + 2*7 = 70.

d) 966
Answer: d
Explanation: General term of above series is ak = 2k*(k2+2) = 2k3+4k
Taking summation from k=1 to k=n on both sides, we get
\(\sum_{i=0}^na_k = 2\sum_{i=0}^nk^3 + 4\sum_{i=0}^nk = 2(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 + 4\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) 
= n2(n+1)2/2+2n(n+1)
= 36*49/2 + 2*6*7

= (12+22+32+……+112) – (22+42+62+82+102)
= (12+22+32+……112) – 22(12+22+32+42+52)
= 11*12*23/6 – 4*5*6*11/6
= 506 – 220
= 286.

Explanation: Equation of circle with center at x-axis (a, 0) and radius r units is
(x-a)2+(y)2=r2
=>(2-a)2+(0)2=r2
And (0-a)2+(4)2=r2
=>(a-2)2=a2+42 => (-2)(2a-2) =16 => a-1=-4 => a=-3
So, r2 = (2+3)2=52
r=5 units.

7. If a circle pass through (4, 0) and (0, 2) and center at y-axis then find the radius of the circle.
a) 25 units
b) 20 units
c) 5 units
d) 10 units
Answer: c
Explanation: Equation of circle with center at y-axis (0, b) and radius r units is
(x)2+(y-b)2=r2
=>(4)2+(-b)2=r2
And (0)2+(2-b)2=r2
=>(b-2)2=b2+42 => (-2)(2b-2)=16 => b-1=-4 => b=-3
So, r2=42+32=52 => r=5 units.

1. Do we have distance formula in 3-D geometry also?
a) True
b) False
Answer: a
Explanation: Yes, we have distance formula in 3-D geometry also. Distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is \(\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}\).

Distance AB = \(\sqrt{(3-5)^2+(2-3)^2+(1+2)^2} = \sqrt{14}\) 
Distance BC = \(\sqrt{(5+1)^2+(3-0)^2+(-2-7)^2} = 3\sqrt{14}\) 
Distance AC = \(\sqrt{(3+1)^2+(2-0)^2+(1-7)^2} = 2\sqrt{14}\) 
Since AB+AC = BC so, the three points are collinear.

Distance AB = \(\sqrt{(1-3)^2+(2-1)^2+(3-2)^2} = \sqrt{6}\) 
Distance BC = \(\sqrt{(3-2)^2+(1-3)^2+(2-1)^2} = \sqrt{6}\) 
Distance CA = \(\sqrt{(2-1)^2+(3-2)^2+(1-3)^2} = \sqrt{6}\) 
Since AB=BC=CA so, it forms equilateral triangle.

5. The three points A (3, 0, 3), B (5, 3, 2), C (6, 5, 5) form ________________
a) equilateral triangle

Distance AB = \(\sqrt{(3-5)^2+(0-3)^2+(3-2)^2} = \sqrt{14}\) 
Distance BC =\(\sqrt{(5-6)^2+(3-5)^2+(2-5)^2} = \sqrt{14}\) 
Distance AC =\(\sqrt{(3-6)^2+(0-5)^2+(3-5)^2} = \sqrt{38}\) 
Since AB =BC so, it forms isosceles triangle.


6. The three points A (7, 0, 10), B (6, -1, 6), C (9, -4, 6) form ________________
a) equilateral triangle
b) right angled triangle
c) isosceles triangle

Distance AB = \(\sqrt{(7-6)^2+(0+1)^2+(10-6)^2} = \sqrt{18}\) 
Distance BC = \(\sqrt{(6-9)^2+(-1+4)^2+(6-6)^2} = \sqrt{18}\) 
Distance AC = \(\sqrt{(7-9)^2+(0+4)^2+(10-6)^2} = \sqrt{36}\) 
Since AB = BC and AB2+BC2 = AC2 so, it forms right angled isosceles triangle.

7. The points A (1, 2, -1), B (5, -2, 1), C (8, -7, 4), D (4, -3, 2) form_____________
a) trapezium
b) rhombus
c) square
d) parallelogram
Answer: d
Explanation: We know, distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is \(\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}\).
Distance AB = \(\sqrt{(1-5)^2+(2+2)^2+(-1-1)^2}\) = 6
Distance BC = \(\sqrt{(5-8)^2+(-2+7)^2+(1-4)^2} = \sqrt{43}\) 
Distance CD = \(\sqrt{(8-4)^2+(-7+3)^2+(4-2)^2}\) = 6
Distance AD = \(\sqrt{(1-4)^2+(2+3)^2+(-1-2)^2} = \sqrt{43}\) 
Since AB=CD and BC=AD i.e. opposite two sides are equal so, it is a parallelogram.

Let the ratio be k : 1.So, the coordinates of a point dividing the line segment joining (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6) internally in the ratio k: 1 is \((\frac{k*4+1*1}{k+1},\frac{k*5+1*2}{k+1},\frac{k*6+1*3}{k+1})\) 
=> \((\frac{k*4+1*1}{k+1},\frac{k*5+1*2}{k+1},\frac{k*6+1*3}{k+1})\) is same as (3, 4, 5).
=> (4k+1)/(k+1) = 3

a) 2
b) 4
c) 1
d) 0
Answer: b
Explanation: y2 – 4 = (y – 2)(y + 2)
Therefore the fraction becomes, (y + 2)
As y tends to 2, the fraction becomes 4


2. What is the value of \(\lim\limits_{y \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2}{y}\)?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) Infinity
Answer: a
Explanation: Any number divided by infinity gives us 0.
Here, since the number 2 is divided by y, as y approaches infinity, we get 0

3. What is the value of \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 4} \frac{x^2-2x-8}{x-4}\)?
a) 0
b) 2
c) 8
d) 6
Answer: d
Explanation: The denominator becomes 0, as x approaches 4.
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 4} \frac{x^2-2x-8}{x-4}\) Here, if we factorize the numerator we get:
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 4} \frac{(x – 4)(x + 2)}{x – 4}\) 
We can now cancel out (x – 4) from both the numerator and denominator.
We get, \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 4}\)(x + 2) = 6



4. What is the value of \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 3}\frac{x^2-9}{x–3}\)?
a) 0
b) 3
c) Infinity
d) 6
Answer: d
Explanation: When x tends to 3, both the numerator and the denominator become 0 and it becomes of the form, \(\frac{0}{0}\).
Therefore, we use L’Hospital’s rule, which states the we differentiate the numerator and the denominator, until a definite answer is reached.
On differentiating once we get,
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 3}\frac{2x}{1}\) 
Since, this not an indeterminate form now, we can substitute the value of x.
= 2 x 3
= 6

5. What is the value of \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{x^2-9}{x^2–3x+2}\)?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 0
d) Limit does not exist
Answer: a
Explanation:
Since it is of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), we use L’Hospital’s rule and differentiate the numerator and denominator 
L = \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{x^2-9}{x^2–3x+2}\) 
On differentiating once, we get \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{2x}{2x}\)

d) \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{x^3+x^2+32x+1}{x^2–3x+2}\) 
Answer: d
Explanation: \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0}\)⁡ 1 = 1 (Since no x term is present) 
When the denominator is infinity, the value of the fraction is 0, provided the numerator is not infinity. 
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\)x-2 + x-1 + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{e^x}\) + 1 = 1 ( e-∞ = 0) 
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{x^3+x^2+32x+1}{x^2–3x+2}\) (Use L’Hospital’s rule and differentiate the numerator and denominator until a rational form is obtained) 
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{x^3+x^2+32x+1}{x^2–3x+2}\) = \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{3x^2+2x+32}{2x–3}\) = \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{3x}{2}\) = ∞

1. Find the derivative of ex2.
a) ex2
b) 2x
c) 2ex2
d) 2xex2
Answer: d
Explanation: We apply chain rule. First we differentiate x2. 
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (x2) = 2x 
Now, we know that \(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex) = ex 
We differentiate ex2 in the same manner and then multiply with the derivative of x2 
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex2) = 2xex2 


2. What is the value of \(\frac{d}{dx}\) (sin⁡ x tan⁡ x)?
a) sin⁡ x + tan⁡ x sec⁡ x
b) cos⁡ x + tan⁡ x sec⁡ x
c) sin⁡ x + tan⁡ x
d) sin⁡ x + tan⁡ x sec2⁡x
Answer: a
Explanation: We follow product rule \(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f.g) = g.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f) + f.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (g)   
Here, f = sin⁡ x and g = tan⁡ x 
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (sin⁡ x tan⁡ x) = cos⁡ x tan⁡ x + sec2⁡ x sinx 
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (sin⁡ x tan⁡ x) = sin⁡ x + tan⁡ x sec⁡ x  

3. What is the value of \(\frac{d}{dx}\) (sin⁡ x3 cos⁡ x2)?
a) 3x2 cos x2 cos⁡ x3 + 2x sin⁡ x3 sin x2
b) 3x2 cos⁡ x2 cos⁡ x3 – 2x  sin⁡ x3 sin x2
c) 2x cos x2 cos⁡ x3 – 2x sin⁡ x3 sin x2
d) 2x cos x2 cos⁡ x3 + 3x2 sin⁡ x3 sin x2
Answer: b
Explanation: We follow product rule\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f.g)= g.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f)+ f.\(\frac{dy}{dx}\) (g) 
Here f = sin⁡ x3 and g = cos⁡ x2 
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f) = 3x2 cos⁡ x3 
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (g) = -2x sin x2 
We now substitute this in our main equation, 
= cos⁡ x2.3x2 cos⁡ x3 + sin⁡ x3.(-2x sin x2) 
= 3x2 cos x2 cos⁡ x3 – 2x sin⁡ x3 sin x2

c) \(\frac{a^x (ln\, ⁡a-1)}{e^x}\) 
d) \(\frac{a^x (ln\, ⁡a-1)}{(e^x)(e^x)}\) 
Answer: c
Explanation: Using quotient rule, we know that, \(\frac{d}{dx} (\frac{f}{g}) = \frac{g.\frac{d}{dx} (f) – f.\frac{d}{dx}(g)}{g^2}\) 
Here, f = ax and g = ex 
\(\frac{d}{dx} (\frac{a^x}{e^x}) = \frac{e^x.\frac{d}{dx}(a^x)-a^x.\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)}{(e^x)(e^x)}\)   
\(\frac{d}{dx} (\frac{a^x}{e^x}) = \frac{e^x a^x ln⁡\, a-a^x e^x}{(e^x)(e^x)}\) 
\(\frac{d}{dx} (\frac{a^x}{e^x}) = \frac{a^x (ln⁡ \,a-1)}{e^x}\)  

5. What is the value of ln ⁡\(\frac{3}{x}\)?
a) ⁡\(\frac{2}{x^3}\) 
b) ⁡\(\frac{-3}{x^3}\) 
c) ⁡\(\frac{-9}{x^3}\) 
d) ⁡\(\frac{9}{x^3}\) 
Answer: c
Explanation: We use chain rule to find \(\frac{d}{dx}\)(ln ⁡\(\frac{3}{x}\)). 
\(\frac{d}{dx}(ln \frac{3}{x}\)) = \(\frac{1}{\frac{3}{x}} \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{3}{x})\) 
\(\frac{d}{dx}(ln \frac{3}{x}\)) = \(\frac{3}{x}(-\frac{3}{x^2})\) 
\(\frac{d}{dx}(ln \frac{3}{x}\)) = \(\frac{-9}{x^3}\)  


6. The derivative of ln⁡ ex = 1. Is the statement true or false?

a) 0
b) 2 cos⁡x
c) 2ex.sin ⁡x
d) 2ex.cos⁡ x
Answer: d
Explanation: We need to use product rule in both the terms to get the answer.
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f.g) = g.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f)+ f.\(\frac{dy}{dx}\) (g)
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex sin x + ex cos ⁡x) = (ex.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (sin⁡ x) + sin ⁡x.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex)) + (ex.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (cos ⁡x) + cos⁡ x.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex))
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex sin x + ex cos ⁡x) =(ex.cos⁡ x + sin ⁡x . ex) + (ex.(-sin ⁡x) + cos ⁡x.ex)
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex sin x + ex cos ⁡x) = ex.cos⁡ x + sin⁡ x . ex – ex.sin⁡ x + cos ⁡x.ex
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex sin x + ex cos ⁡x) = 2ex.cos⁡ x


8. What is the value of \(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex tan x) at x = 0?
a) 0
b) 1
c) -1
d) 2
Answer: b
Explanation: We need to use product rule in both the terms to get the answer.
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f.g) = g.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f)+ f.\(\frac{dy}{dx}\) (g)
Here f = ex and g = tan ⁡x
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex tan x) = tan⁡ x.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex) + ex.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (tan ⁡x)
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex tan x) = tan⁡ x.ex + ex . sec2⁡x
At x = 0 we get,
= tan ⁡0.e0 + e0.sec2⁡0
= 0.(1) + 1.(1)
= 1

9. What is the value of \(\frac{d}{dx}\)(cos2⁡ x  tan⁡ x) at x = 1?
a) -1
b) 0
c) -2
d) 1
Answer: d
Explanation: We need to use product rule in both the terms to get the answer.
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f.g) = g.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (f) + f.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (g)
Here f = cos2⁡ x and g = tan ⁡x
To differentiate f, we need to use chain rule.
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (cos2 ⁡x tan⁡ x) = tan ⁡x.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (cos2 x) + cos2 x.\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (tan⁡ x)
\(\frac{d}{dx}\) (ex tan⁡x) = tan⁡ x.(-2 cos⁡ x sin⁡ x) + cos2 ⁡x.sec2 x
At x = 1 we get,
= tan⁡0.(-2 cos⁡ 0 sin⁡ 0) + cos2⁡ 0.sec2 ⁡0
= 1


10. What is the value of \(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos⁡x}{sec⁡x \,tan⁡x})\)?
a) -tan2⁡ x(3 sin2⁡ x – cos2 x)
b) -cot2 x(3 sin2⁡ x – cos2 x)
c) -cot2 x(3 sin2⁡ x + cos2 x)
d) -tan2⁡ x(3 sin2⁡ x + cos2 x)
Answer: c
Explanation: \(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos⁡x}{sec⁡x \,tan⁡x}) = \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos⁡x}{\frac{1}{cos⁡x}\frac{sin⁡x}{cos⁡x}})\) 
=\(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos^3⁡x}{sin⁡x})\) 
Using quotient rule, we know that, \(\frac{d}{dx} (\frac{f}{g}) = \frac{g.\frac{d}{dx} (f) – f.\frac{d}{dx}(g)}{g^2}\) 
Here, f = cos3⁡ x and g = sin ⁡x 
\(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos^3⁡x}{sin⁡x})\) = \(\frac{sin⁡x.\frac{d}{dx} (cos^3⁡x)-cos^3⁡x.\frac{d}{dx}(sinx)}{sin^2⁡x}\)  
\(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos^3⁡x}{sin⁡x})\) = \(\frac{sin⁡x (-3 cos^2⁡ x \,sin⁡ x) – cos^3⁡x(cos⁡x)}{sin^2⁡x}\)  
\(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos^3⁡x}{sin⁡x})\) = \(\frac{-3 sin^2⁡x \,cos^2⁡x – cos^4⁡x}{sin^2⁡x}\)  
\(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{cos^3⁡x}{sin⁡x})\) = -cot2⁡ x(3 sin2⁡ x + cos2 x) 

11. What is the value of \(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{sec⁡x}{cosec\, x \,tan⁡x}\))?
a) 0
b) 1
c) cos ⁡x
d) sin ⁡x
Answer: a
Explanation: \(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{sec⁡x}{cosec\, x\, tan⁡x})\) = \(\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{{1} {cos⁡x}}{\frac{1}{sin⁡\, x}.\frac{sin⁡x}{cos⁡x}}\)) 
= \(\frac{d}{dx}\) (1) 
= 0

1. At which point will f(x) attain a minima where, \(\mbox{f}(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}
(x^3+x^2+10x & \mbox{$x \gt 0$} \\
3 sinx, & \mbox{$x \leq 0$}
\end{array} \right.
\)?
a) f(x) has a local minima at x = 0
b) f(x) has a local minima at x > 0
c) f(x) has a local minima at x < 0
d) f(x) has a local minima at x ≥ 0
Answer: a
Explanation: We can see that f(x) is continuous at x = 0	……(1)
Differentiating (1) with respect to x at -0 and +0, we get
\(\mbox{f}(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}
(3x^2+2x+10 & \mbox{$x \gt 0$} \\
 3 cosxx \leq 0
\end{array} \right.
\) 
So, f’–(0) = \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(0 – h) – f(0)}{-h}\)  
=> f’ –(0) = -10 
And, f’ +(0) = \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(0 + h) – f(0)}{-h}\)  
=> f’ +(0) = 3
Thus f(x) has a local minima at x = 0.


2. At which point will f(x) attain a maxima where, \(\mbox{f}(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}
(sin(\frac{\pi x}{2}), & \mbox{$x \gt 1$} \\
3 – 2x, & \mbox{$x \geq 1$}
\end{array} \right.
\)?
a) x = -1
b) x = 0
c) x = 1
d) x = ½
Answer: c
Explanation: Clearly, f(x) is continuous as x = 1as,
f(1 – 0) = f(1 + 0) = f(1) = 0
Now, f’-(1) = \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(1 – h) – f(0)}{-h}\) 
= \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{sin(\frac{\pi}{2})(1-h)-1}{-h}\) 
So, it is clear that this can be written as,
= \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{cos(\frac{\pi}{2})-1}{-h}\) 
= \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{2 sin^2(\frac{\pi h}{4})}{h}\) 
= 0 
Now, f’ +(1) = \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(1 + h) – f(1)}{h}\) 
= \(\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{3-2(1+h)-1}{h}\)
= -2 
Now, from here we can say that f’ –(1) = 0 whereas, f’ +(1) = -2 
Thus, it is clear that there is a local maxima at x = 1.

3. f(x) is a polynomial of degree 4, vanishes at x = -1 and has local minimum/maximum at x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3. If, -2∫2 f(x) dx = -1348/15. Then what is the value of f(x)?
a) x4 – 8x3 + 22x2 – 24x – 55
b) x4 – 8x3 + 22x2 – 24x + 55
c) x4 – 8x3 – 22x2 – 24x – 55
d) Data not sufficient
Answer: a
Explanation: Here it is given that f(x) is a polynomial of degree 4 
So, it has critical points at x=1, x=2 and x=3 
So, f’(x) = A(x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)
	= A(x3 – 6x2 + 11x -6) 
On integrating this, gives, 
f(x) = A/4(x4 – 8x3 + 22x2 – 24x) + B 
Also, f(-1) = 0 
So, we get, 
B = -554A/4 
Also, it is given that -2∫2 f(x) dx = -1348/15 
So, A/4 -2∫2(x4 – 8x3 + 22x2 – 24x – 55)dx = -1348/15 
By changing the range of the integrals, we get, 
=> A/2 0∫2(x4 + 22x2 – 55) dx = -1348/15 
=> -337A/15 = -1348/15 
=> A = 4  
Thus, f(x) = x4 – 8x3 + 22x2 – 24x – 55. 



4. What will be the maximum area of an isosceles triangle inscribed in the ellipse x2/a2 + y2/b2 = 1 if its vertex at one end of the major axis?
a) 3√3/4 ab sq units
b) 3√3/2 ab sq units
c) √3/2 ab sq units
d) 3/4 ab sq units
Answer: a
Explanation: Let A, B, C be the vertices of the isosceles triangle.
Let B = (a cosθ, b sinθ)
=> C – (a cosθ. -b sinθ)  (by symmetry).
Now, area of a triangle is given by 
A = ½(BC)(AD)
   = ½(2b sinθ)(1 + cosθ) 
=> dA/dθ = ab[cosθ(1 + cosθ) – sin2θ] 
	   = ab(1 + cosθ)(2 cosθ – 1) 
Now, putting dA/dθ = 0, 
We get, θ = π/3, π 
Now, for θ = π, triangle ABC is not possible. 
And, dA/dθ]θ = π/3 < 0, 
Thus, for θ = π/3, the area of isosceles triangle will be maximum. 
So, A = 3√3/4 ab sq units. 

5. What is the value of (∞)0 and 1∞?
a) (0, 1)
b) (1, 0)
c) They are indeterminate form
d) (1, 1)
Answer: c
Explanation: If there are forms like ∞-∞, 0*∞, 00, (∞)0 and 1∞ then they are said to be indeterminate form.
Then to evaluate the limiting value of the function at the point, L’Hospital’s rule is used.


6. If f(x) = |4x – x2 – 3| when x € [0, 4], then, which of the following is correct?
a) x = 1 is the global maximum
b) x = 2 is the global maximum
c) x = 3 is the global maximum
d) x = 0 is the global maximum
Answer: c
Explanation: Clearly, x = 1, 3 are the points of global minimum (as the values being equal).
And, x = 0, 4 are the points of global maximum (as the values being equal).
And, x = 2, is the point of local maximum (as the values being equal).
Thus, x = 3 is the global maximum.

7. At which point does f(x) will attain local minima if f(x) = 0∫x (t+1)(et – 1)(t – 2)(t + 4) dt?
a) 0
b) -1
c) 1
d) -4
Answer: b
Explanation: Here, f(x) = 0∫x (t + 1)(et – 1)(t – 2)(t + 4) dt 
So, f’(x) = (x + 1)(ex – 1)(x – 2)(x + 4) 
So, ────+───-4|─────–──────-1|──────+──────0|───────–──────2|────+────	
Clearly, x = -1 and x = 2 are points of local minima. 
As, x = 2 is not present so it is -1. 


8. What will be the value of \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1} x^{\frac{1}{1-x}}\)?
a) 1/e
b) e
c) 0
d) 1
Answer: a
Explanation: We have, y = x(1/(1 – x)) 
So, log y = (log x)/(1 – x) 
So, \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1}\)log y = \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1}\)(log x)/(1 – x) 
Now, using L’Hospital’s rule, 
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1}\)log y = \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1}\)((\(\frac{1}{x})\) / – 1)  
=>, \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1}\)log y = -1 
So, \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1} x^{\frac{1}{1-x}}\) = 1/e. 

9. Is Rolle’s theorem valid for f(x) = x2 – 3x + 4 in the interval [1, 2]?
a) Yes
b) No
c) Depends on x
d) Data not sufficient
Answer: a
Explanation: Obviously, f(x) is continuous at [1, 2] 
And, f(x) differentiable at [1, 2] 
Also, f(1) = f(2) = 2
Now, f’(x) = 0
=> 2x – 3 = 0
=> x = 3/2
Thus, x belongs to [1, 2] 
Hence, it is verified.


10. Let f (x) = (x – a) (x – b) (x – c), a < b < c. Then  f'(x) = 0 has two roots. At which interval does these roots belongs?
a) Both the roots in (a, b) 
b) At least one root in (a, b) and at least one root in (b, c) 
c) Both the roots in (b, c) 
d) Neither in (a, b) nor in (b, c) 
Answer: b
Explanation: Here, f (x) being a polynomial is continuous and differentiable for all real values of x. 
We also have f(a) = f(b) = f(c). If we apply Rolle’s theorem to f (x) in [a, b] and [b, c] we will observe that f'(x) = 0 will have at least one root in (a, b) and at least one root in (b, c). 
But f'(x) is a polynomial of degree two, so that f'(x) = 0 can’t have more than two roots. It implies that exactly one root of f'(x) = 0 will lie in (a, b) and exactly one root off'(x) = 0 will lie in (b, c). 
Let y = f(x) be a polynomial function of degree n. If f (x) = 0 has real roots only, then f'(x) = 0, f”(x) = 0, … , fn-1(x) = 0 will have real roots. It is in fact the general version of above mentioned application, because if f (x) = 0 have all real roots, then between two consecutive roots of f(x) = 0, exactly one root of f'(x) = 0 will lie.

1. If A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2) be two points on the curve y = ax2 + bx + c, then as perLagrange’s mean value theorem whichof the following is correct?
a) At least one point C(x3, y3) where the tangent will be intersecting the chord AB
b) At least one point C(x3, y3) where the tangent will be overlapping to the chord AB
c) At least two points where the tangent will be parallel to the chord AB
d) At least one point C(x3, y3) where the tangent will be parallel to the chord AB
Answer: d
Explanation: Here, y = f(x) = ax2 + bx + c
As f(x) is a polynomial function, it is continuous and differentiable for all x.
So, according to geometrical interpretation of mean value theorem there will be at least one point C (x3, y3) between A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2) where tangent will be parallel chord AB.


2. If \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a}\frac{(a^x-x^a)}{x^x-a^a}\) = -1 then, what is the value of a?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
Answer: a
Explanation: Let, y = xx
Thus, log y = x log x
Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get,
1/y dy/dx = (x*1/x) + log x
=>dy/dx = y(1 + log x)
Or, dxx/dx = xx(1 + log x)
Using, L’Hospital’s rule,
\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a}\frac{(a^x-x^a)}{x^x-a^a}\) = \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a}\frac{(a^x*log⁡a-x^{a-1})}{x^x(1+logx)}\) 
= \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a}\frac{(a^a*log⁡a-a^{a})}{a^a(1+loga)}\) 
= (log a – 1)/(log a + 1)
As per the question,
(log a – 1)/(log a + 1) = -1
Or, (log a – 1) = -log a – 1
Or, 2 log a = 0
Or, log a = 0
So, a = 1

3. If functions f(x) and g(x) are continuous in [a, b] and differentiable in (a, b) then which of the following is correct if there exists at least one point c, a < c < b, such that \(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f(b) \\g(a) & g(b) \end {vmatrix}\)?
a) (b + a)\(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f”(c) \\g(a) & g”(c) \end {vmatrix}\) 
b) (b – a)\(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f”(c) \\g(a) & g”(c) \end {vmatrix}\) 
c) (b + a)\(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f'(c) \\g(a) & g'(c) \end {vmatrix}\) 
d) (b – a)\(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f'(c) \\g(a) & g'(c) \end {vmatrix}\) 
Answer: d
Explanation: Let, F(x) = \(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f(b) \\g(a) & g(b) \end {vmatrix}\) = f(a)g(x) – f(x)g(a)       …..(1) 
=> F’(x) = f’(a)g’(x) – f’(x)g(a) 
Since, f(x) and g(x) are continuous in [a, b] and differentiable in (a, b), 
So, F(x) is continuous in [a, b] and differentiable in (a, b) 
Also from (1), F(a) = f(a)g(a) – f(a)g(a) = 0  
And F(b) = f(a)g(b) – f(b)g(a) 
Now, by the mean value theorem, there exists at least one point c, a < c < b, such that, 
F’(c) = (F’(b) – F’(a)) / (b – a) 
=> f(a) g’(c) – g(a) f’(c) = (f(a)g(b) – f(b)g(a) – 0)/b – a 
Or, f(a)g(b) – f(b)g(a) = (b – a)( f(a) g’(c) – g(a) f’(c)) 
=>\(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f(b) \\g(a) & g(b) \end {vmatrix}\) = (b – a)\(\begin{vmatrix}f(a) & f'(c) \\g(a) & g'(c) \end {vmatrix}\) 



4. What is the number of critical points of f(x) = |x2 – 1| / x2?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
Answer: c
Explanation:Clearly f (x) is not differentiable at x = 1 and x = -1
And x = 0 is not a critical point not in the domain.
Therefore 1 and -1 are critical points.
Thus, there are 2 critical points.

5. What will be the value of dy/dx if x = asec2θ and y = atan3θ at θ = π/4?
a) 1/2
b) 3/4
c) 3/2
d) 1/4
Answer: c
Explanation: Since, x = asec2θ,
Therefore, dx/dθ = a*d/dx(sec2θ)
= 2asecθ*secθ tanθ
Again, dy/dθ = a*d/dx(tan3θ)
= a * 3 tan2θ * d/dθ(tanθ)
= 3a tan2θ sec2θ
 Therefore, dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ)
= 3a tan2θ sec2θ/2asecθ*secθ tanθ
Thus, at θ = π/4 we have,
dy/dx = 3/2(tan π/4)
= 3/2


6. What is the number of critical points for f(x) = max(sinx, cosx) for x belonging to (0, 2π)?
a) 2
b) 5
c) 3
d) 4
Answer: c
Explanation: We know that in the range of (0, 2π) the graph of sinx and cosx intersects each other in three points.
And we know that these points of intersection are only the critical points
Thus, there are 3 critical points.

7. If y = (3x – 4)/(x+2) then what s the value of dy/dx?
a) dy/dx
b) y
c) 1/ (dy/dx)
d) A constant
Answer: c
Explanation: It is given that y = (3x – 4)/(x + 2)	……….(1)
Now differentiating both the sides, we get that,
dy/dx = (x + 2)*3 – (3x – 4)/(x + 2)2
= 10/(x + 2)2
Again from (1) we get,
xy + 2y = 3x – 4
or, x = – 2(y + 2)
Thus dx/dy = -2* ((y – 3) – (y + 2))/ (y – 3)2
Or, y – 3 = (3x – 4)/(x + 2) – 3
= -10/(x + 2)
Thus, dx/dy = 10/(-10/(x + 2))2
= (x + 2)2/10, where,x ≠ 0 i.e. dx/dy ≠ 0
Therefore, dy/dx*dx/dy = 10/(x + 2)2 * -10/(x + 2)
= 1
=> dy/dx = 1/(dy/dx)


8. What is the value of (dy/dx)2 + 1 if x = a sin2θ(1 + cos2θ) and y = a cos2θ(1 – cos2θ)?
a) Tan2θ
b) Cosec2θ
c) Cot2θ
d) Sec2θ
Answer: d
Explanation: Here, x = a sin2θ(1 + cos2θ) and y = a cos2θ(1 – cos2θ)
=> x = 2a cos2θ*sin2θ and y = 2a sin2θ*cos2θ
Now differentiating x and y with respect to θ we get,
dx/dθ = 2a[cos2θ*2cos2θ + sin2θ*2cos2θ cos2θ] 
= 4a cosθ (cosθ cos2θ – sinθ sin2θ )
= 4a cosθ cos(θ + 2θ)
= 4a cosθ cos3θ
dy/dθ = 2a[cos2θ*2cosθ sinθ + sin2θ (-2sin2θ)] 
= 4a sinθ (cosθ cos2θ – sinθ sin2θ )
= 4a sinθ cos(θ + 2θ)
= 4a sinθ cos3θ
Thus, dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ)
= (= 4a cosθ cos3θ)/( 4a sinθ cos3θ)
= tanθ
So, (dy/dx)2 + 1 = 1 + tan2θ = sec2θ

9. If, y = 1/(1 + x + x2 + x3), then what is the value of y’ at x = 0?
a) 0
b) 1
c) -1
d) ½
Answer: c
Explanation: Given, y = 1/(1 + x + x2 + x3)
Assuming x ≠ 1
Or, y = (x – 1)/(x – 1)( x3 + x2 + x + 1)
Differentiating both the sides with respect to x, we get,
dy/dx = [(x4 – 1)*1 – (x – 1)*4x3]/ (x4 – 1)2
Thus, putting x = 0 in the above equation, we get,
(dy/dx) = -1/(-1)2
= -1

1. Whichis greater (1/2)e or 1/e2 if there is a given function sinx(sinx), 0 < x < π?
a) 1/e2
b) (1/2)e
c) Data not sufficient
d) Varies as the value of x changes
Answer: b
Explanation: Let, f(x) = sinx(sinx) 
So, f(x) = esinx log sinx 
So, on differentiating it we get, 
f’(x) = sinx(sinx) [cosx log sinx + cos x] 
So, f’(x) = 0 when, x = sin-1(1/e) or x = π/2 
Also, f”(x) = sinx(sinx)[cos2x(1 + log sinx)2 – sinx log sinx + (cos2x/sinx) – sinx] 
So that, f”(sin-1(1/e)) = (e – 1/e)e-1/e 
And, f”(π/2) = -1 
Hence, f(x) has local as well as global minimum at x = sin-1(1/e) also have local and global maximum at x = π/2 
Global minimum value of f(x) is (1/e)1/e 
It therefore follows that , 
sin π/6 (sinπ/6) > (1/e)1/e 
=>(1/2)1/2 > (1/e)1/e 
=>(1/2)e > 1/e2 


2. The function y = f(x) is represented parametrically by x = t5 – 5t3 – 20t + 7 and y = 4t3 – 3t2 – 18t + 3 (-2 < t < 2). At which point does y = f(x) has a minimum value?
a) t = -1
b) t = 0
c) t = 1/2
d) t = 3/2
Answer: d
Explanation: We have dx/dt = Φ’(t) 
Φ’(t) = 5(t2 – 4)(t2 + 1) ≠ 0 if -2 < t < 2 
And dy/dt = 12t2 – 6t – 18 
Also, dy/dt = 0 
=> t = -1 or t = 3/2 
Now, d2y/dt2 = 24t – 8 
=> d2(-1)/dt2 = -30 and, d2(3/2)/dt2 = 30 
Consequently, y = f(x) has maximum at t = -1 minimum at t = 3/2    

3. Which of the following is correct for the nature of the roots x5 – a0x4 + 3ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0 if it is given that 2a02 < 15 and a0, a, b, c, d are real?
a) Can’t be real
b) Equal
c) Real
d) Depends on the value of x
Answer: a
Explanation: Let f(x) = x5 – a0x4 + 3ax3 + bx2 + cx + d so that,
Now, f’(x) = 5x5 – 4a0x3 + 9ax2 + 2bx + c
And, f”(x) = 20x3 – 12a0x2 + 18ax + 2b
And, f”(x) = 60x2 – 24a0x + 18a
= 6(10x2 – 4a0x + 3a)
Now, discriminant of 10x2 – 4a0x + 3a = 16a02 – 4
And it is given 8(2a02 – 15a) < 0
Hence, root of f”’(x) can’t be real
=>all the roots can’t be real.



4. What will be the domain of the function, if 3x + 3f(x) = minimum of Φ(t), where Φ(t) = minimum of (2t3 – 15t2 + 36t – 25, 2 + |sint|; 2 ≤ t ≤ 4} ?
a) (-∞, 1)
b) (-∞, loge3)
c) (0, loge2)
d) (-∞, loge2)
Answer: d
Explanation: Let, g(t) = 2t3 – 15t2 + 36t -25
g’(t) = 6t2 – 30t + 36 = 0
=> 6(t2 – 5t + 6) = 0
=> t = 2, 3
For, 2 ≤ t ≤ 4, at t = 3, g”(t) > 0
So, g(t) is minimum.
g(t)min = g(3) = 2*27 – 15*9 + 36*3 – 25 = 2
Also, 2 + |sint| ≥ 2
Hence, minimum Φ(t) = 2
Therefore, 3x + 3f(x) = 2
=>3f(x) = 2 – 3x
Thus, 3f(x) > 0
=> 3x > 0 and 3x < 2
Therefore, x € (-∞, loge2)

5. If, y = cos(2sin-1x), then what is the value of (1 – x2)y” – xy’ + 4y?
a) –1
b) 0
c) 1
d) Depends on the value of x
Answer: b
Explanation: We have, y = cos(2sin-1x)
Differentiating both the sides,
y’ = d/dxcos(2sin-1x)
= -sin(2sin-1x) * d/dx(2sin-1x)
or, y’ = -sin(2sin-1x)*2*1/√(1 – x2)
or, y’*√(1 – x2) = -2sin(2sin-1x)
Squaring both sides,
or, (y’)2 *(1 – x2) = 4sin2(2sin-1x)
or, (y’)2 *(1 – x2) = 4(1 – y2)
Differentiating again with respect to x, we get,
(1 – x2)*2y’y” + (y’)2 (-2x) = 4 * (-2yy’)
(1 – x2)y” – xy’ = – 4y
=> (1 – x2)y” – xy’ + 4y = 0


6. What will be the form of the equation after eliminating a and b from the equation y = a sin-1x + b cos-1x?
a) (1 – x2)y” + xy’ = 0
b) (1 – x2)y” – xy’ = 0
c) (1 + x2)y” – xy’ = 0
d) (1 + x2)y” + xy’ = 0
Answer: b
Explanation: We have, y = a sin-1x + b cos-1x
Differentiating both sides with respect to x we get,
dy/dx = 12∫ e2xcos3x dx – 5∫ e2x sin3x dx
y’ = a* 1/√(1 – x2) + b * (-1/√(1 – x2))
or, y’√(1 – x2) = a – b
now, squaring both sides,
or, y’2(1 – x2) = (a – b)2
Differentiating again with respect to x we get,
(1 – x2) * 2y’y” + y’2 . (-2x) = 0
As, y’ ≠ 0,
(1 – x2)y” – xy’ = 0

7. What is the value of 4a cos3θ(d2y/dx2) if x = a sin2θ(1 + cos2θ) and y = a cos2θ(1 – cos2θ)?
a) [1 + (d2y/dx2)2]3/2
b) [1 – (d2y/dx2)2]3/2
c) [1 + (d2y/dx2)2]1/2
d) [1 – (d2y/dx2)2]1/2
Answer: a
Explanation: Here, x = a sin2θ(1 + cos2θ) and y = a cos2θ(1 – cos2θ) 
=> x = 2a cos2θ*sin2θ and y = 2a sin2θ*cos2θ 
Now differentiating x and y with respect to θ we get, 
dx/dθ = 2a[cos2θ*2cos2θ + sin2θ*2cos2θ cos2θ] 
= 4a cosθ (cosθ cos2θ – sinθ sin2θ) 
= 4a cosθ cos(θ + 2θ)
= 4a cosθ cos3θ
dy/dθ = 2a[cos2θ*2cosθ sinθ + sin2θ (-2sin2θ)] 
= 4a sinθ (cosθ cos2θ – sinθ sin2θ ) 
= 4a sinθ cos(θ + 2θ)
= 4a sinθ cos3θ
Thus, dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ)
= (= 4a cosθ cos3θ)/( 4a sinθ cos3θ)
= tanθ
So, (d2y/dx2) = d/dx(tanθ) 
= sec2θ*dθ/dx 
= sec2θ*(1/(dx/dθ)) 
= sec2θ*1/(4a cosθ cos3θ)
Or, 4a cos3θ (d2y/dx2) = sec3θ
= (sec2θ)3/2
= (1 + tan2θ)3/2
As, dy/dx = tanθ
So, 4a cos3θ(d2y/dx2) = [1 + (d2y/dx2)2]3/2


8. Given, y = tan-1 √(x2 – 1) then what is the value of (2x2 – 1)y’ + x(x2 – 1)y”?
a) -1
b) 0
c) 1
d) 2
Answer: b
Explanation: We have, y = tan-1 √(x2 – 1)
Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get,
y’ = 1/(1 + x2 – 1)* d/dx(x2 – 1)1/2
1/x2 * 1/2((x2 – 1))1/2 * 2x
Squaring both sides,
x2(x2 – 1)(y’)2 = 1
Differentiating again with respect to x we get,
x2(x2 – 1)(y’)2 + (y’)2d/dx(x4 – x2) = d/dx(1)
Or, x2(x2 – 1)2y’y” + (y’)2(4x3 – 2x) = 0
Or, x2(x2 – 1)y” + (y’)(2x3 – x) = 0

9. What is the value of (x + y)2y” if x = et sint and y = et cost?
a) x/2(y’ + y)
b) x/2(y’ – y)
c) 2(xy’ + y)
d) 2(xy’ – y)
Answer: d
Explanation: Since, x = et sint and y = et cost
Therefore, dx/dt = et sint + et cost
= y + x
And, dy/dt = et cost – et sint
= y – x
So, y’ = dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = (y – x)/(y + x)
Thus, y” = [(x + y)(y’ – 1) – (y – x)(y’ + 1)]/(x + y)2
Or, (x + y)2y” = (x + y – y + x)y’ – x – y + x
= 2xy’ – 2y
= 2(xy’ – y)


10. If, y = (sin-1x)2, then what is the value of (1 – x2)y” – xy’ + 4?
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 8
Answer: c
Explanation: We have, y = (sin-1x)2	………..(1)
Differentiating with respect to x, we get,
y’ = 2(sin-1x)*1/(1 – x2)1/2
or, y’(1 – x2)1/2 = 2(sin-1x)
Squaring both sides,
(1 – x2)(y’)2 = 4(sin-1x)2
From (1),
(1 – x2)( y’)2 = 4y
Differentiating with respect to x, we get
(1 – x2)y” + (y’)2 d/dx(1 – x2) = 4 y’
=>(1 – x2)2y’y” + (y’)2 (-2x) = 4y’
Or, (1 – x2)y” – xy’ = 2
Or, (1 – x2)y” – xy’ + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6

11. If, y = tan-1(x/a), then what is the value of y’?
a) (2ax/(x2 – a2)2)
b) -(2ax/(x2 – a2)2)
c) (2ax/(x2 + a2)2)
d) -(2ax/(x2 + a2)2)
Answer: d
Explanation: We have, y = tan-1(x/a)
Differentiating two times, with respect to x, we get,
y’ = d/dx(tan-1(x/a))
= 1/(1 + (x/a)2)*d/dx(x/a)
= a2/(x2 + a2)* 1/a
= a/(x2 + a2)
y” = d/dx (a/(x2 + a2))
= a* d/dx(x2 + a2)-1
= a(-1) (x2 + a2)-2*d/dx(x2 + a2)
Now solving we get,
= -a/(x2 + a2)2*2x
= -(2ax/(x2 + a2)2)

d) 1/18
Answer: d
Explanation: If two dice are simultaneously rolled then total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 =36.
We can get 11 as sum in these cases {(5,6), (6,5)}. So, probability of getting sum 11 is 2/36 = 1/18.

5. A coin is tossed and a dice is rolled simultaneously what is total number of possible outcomes?
a) 2
b) 6
c) 12
d) 24
Answer: c
Explanation: If a coin is tossed and a dice is rolled simultaneously then total number of possible outcomes will be 2*6 =12.


6. A coin is tossed and if head come then a red dice is rolled and if tail come then a blue dice is rolled then what is the possible number of outcomes?
a) 6
b) 12
c) 24
d) 72
Answer: b
Explanation: If head come on coin then red dice can have 6 outcomes so total 1*6 = 6 outcomes.                                           And if tail come on coin then blue dice can have 6 outcomes so total 1*6 = 6 outcomes.
So, total number of possible outcomes = 6 + 6 = 12.

7. If 4 bulbs are there each of which can be defective or non-defective then what is the total number of possible outcomes?
a) 8
b) 16
c) 4
d) 2
Answer: b
Explanation: Each bulb can have two cases i.e. either defective or non-defective. Then total number of outcomes will be 24 = 16.


8. If 4 bulbs are there each of which can be defective or non-defective then what is the probability that all the bulbs are defective?
a) 1/8
b) 1/16
c) 1/4
d) 1/2
Answer: b
Explanation: Each bulb can have two cases i.e. either defective or non-defective. Then total number of outcomes will be 24 = 16.
So, the probability that all the bulbs are defective is 1/16.

9. If 4 bulbs are there each of which can be defective or non-defective then what is the probability that at least one bulb is non- defective?
a) 7/8
b) 15/16
c) 3/4
d) 1/2
Answer: b
Explanation: Each bulb can have two cases i.e. either defective or non-defective. Then total number of outcomes will be 24 = 16.
Probability that all the bulbs are defective is 1/16.
So, the probability that at least one bulb is non-defective is 1-1/16 = 15/16.


10. The probability can be negative.
a) True
b) False
Answer: b
Explanation: Since probability is the ratio of number of outcomes in favour to total number of possible outcomes and number (counting) cannot be negative so, probability cannot be negative.

3. Which symbol denote impossible event?
a) S
b) Φ
c) β
d) μ
Answer: b
Explanation: Impossible event has no outcome in favour. So, it is denoted by empty set Φ.



4. What is the probability of impossible event?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 1/2
d) 1/4
Answer: a
Explanation: Impossible event has no outcome in favour. And probability is ratio of number of outcomes in favour to the total number of possible outcomes. So, probability of impossible event is zero.

5. Which symbol denotes sure event?
a) S
b) Φ
c) β
d) μ
Answer: a
Explanation: Sure event has all outcomes in favour.
So, it is denoted by sample space S.


6. What is the probability of a sure event?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 1/2
d) 1/4
Answer: b
Explanation: Sure event has all outcomes in favour i.e. number of outcomes in favour equal to the total number of possible outcomes.
And probability is ratio of number of outcomes in favour to the total number of possible outcomes.
So, probability of sure event will be 1.

7. Which of the following cannot be the value of probability?
a) 1
b) -1
c) 0
d) 1/2
Answer: b
Explanation: Since probability is ratio of number of outcomes in favour to the total number of possible outcomes. So, it cannot be negative.


8. Which of the following cannot be the value of probability?
a) 1
b) 1/4
c) 0
d) 2
Answer: d
Explanation: Since probability is ratio of number of outcomes in favour to the total number of possible outcomes. And number of outcomes in favour are always less than or equal to total number of possible outcomes. So, probability is always less than or equal to 1.

9. What is the probability of getting a number greater than 6 on dice?
a) 0
b) 1/2
c) 1/3
d) 1
Answer: a

10. If an event has only one sample point then it is called _________________
a) simple event
b) compound event
c) impossible event
d) sure event
Answer: a
Explanation: If an event has only one sample point then it is called simple event.
e.g. All heads on tossing n coins.

11. If an event has more than one sample point then it is called _____________
a) simple event
b) compound event
c) impossible event
d) sure event
Answer: b
Explanation: If an event has more than one sample point then it is called compound event.
e.g. at least one head appears on tossing n coins.

12. If two coins are tossed simultaneously then “Exactly one head appears” is simple event or not.
a) True
b) False
Answer: b
Explanation: If two coins are tossed simultaneously then S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.
“Exactly one head appears” includes HT, TH. It has more than one sample point so it is compound event not simple event.

13. For every event there exist some complementary event.
a) True
b) False
Answer: a
Explanation: Yes, for every event there exist some complementary event. If the event is A then complementary event is not A.

14. What is a complementary event for “At least one head appears” if two coins are tossed simultaneously?
a) Exactly one head appears
b) At least one tail appears
c) At most one tail appears
d) None head appears
Answer: d
Explanation: We know complementary of at least one is none. So, complementary event for “At least one head appears” is none head appears.

15. What is the representation of complementary event of event A?
a) S-A
b) A-S
c) S
d) S+A
Answer: a
Explanation: If the event is A then complementary event is not A.
Not A means S-A. So, complementary event of event A is represented by A’ = S-A.
